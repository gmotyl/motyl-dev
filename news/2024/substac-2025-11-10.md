## Leaders who use AI daily scale it 3x faster than those who delegate

**TLDR:** McKinsey research shows that 88% of companies use AI in at least one function, but 67% remain stuck in pilot mode. The key differentiator is whether executives personally use AI tools themselves rather than just sponsoring initiatives from afar.

**Summary:**

This McKinsey study exposes a critical gap in AI transformation that goes beyond the usual suspects of budget constraints or technology selection. The research reveals a stark reality: leaders who personally rebuild their workflows with AI tools are three times more likely to successfully scale these technologies across their organizations compared to executives who simply delegate AI initiatives to their teams.

The numbers paint a clear picture of organizational inertia. While nearly nine out of ten companies have adopted AI in some capacity, two-thirds remain trapped in endless pilot programs. This isn't a technology problem or a resource allocation issue. It's fundamentally about leadership engagement and understanding. When executives use AI tools themselves, they transform from mandate-givers into demonstrators of actual value. Their teams stop seeing AI as another top-down directive and start recognizing it as a proven tool with tangible benefits.

The article highlights compelling examples of transformative leadership in action. Marc Benioff at Salesforce didn't just champion AI adoption; he retrained himself to use AI for strategic planning. United Airlines executives personally rebuilt crew scheduling processes, reducing reassignment time from forty-five minutes to just ninety seconds. These aren't feel-good stories about empathetic leadership. They represent executives who discovered friction points firsthand before asking their teams to navigate those same challenges.

Personal use becomes organizational reconnaissance. Leaders who engage directly with AI tools understand where data integration fails, where automation assumptions break down, and where workflow bottlenecks actually exist. This hands-on experience enables them to solve real problems for their teams rather than asking teams to solve problems the leadership doesn't fully comprehend. The research shows that high-performing organizations are three times more likely to pursue transformative change rather than incremental improvements, which means completely redesigning processes rather than layering AI onto existing broken workflows.

For architects and engineering teams, this research has profound implications for how AI initiatives should be structured and championed within organizations. Rather than waiting for executive buy-in through presentations and pilot results, teams should focus on getting leadership to personally experience AI tools in their own workflows first. This approach creates informed advocates who understand both the potential and limitations of AI implementation at an organizational scale.

**Key takeaways:**
- Personal AI usage by executives is the strongest predictor of successful organizational scaling, not budget or technology choices
- Companies that redesign processes with AI as the foundation see transformative results, while those layering AI onto broken processes experience friction
- Only 39% of organizations see enterprise-level EBIT impact from AI, with most gains under 5% because they focus on cost savings rather than growth and new business models

**Tradeoffs:**
- Pursuing transformative AI implementation delivers step-change returns but requires killing old workflows and redefining organizational roles
- Personal executive engagement with AI tools creates informed decision-making but demands significant time investment from leadership
- Redesigning processes around AI enables breakthrough performance improvements but introduces implementation complexity and change management challenges
