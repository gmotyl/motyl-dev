## AI Made Me 50x Faster — And Somehow More Lazy

**TLDR:** After three years of AI use, the author discovered they were outsourcing thinking to AI instead of thinking with it, leading to degraded problem-solving skills despite increased productivity. The solution: shift from "do this for me" to "help me understand this."

**Summary:**

This piece tackles a critical but underexplored consequence of AI adoption in knowledge work. The author's journey from AI euphoria to cognitive dependency mirrors what many developers and architects are experiencing but rarely discussing openly. The initial productivity gains are real and intoxicating—tasks that took hours compress into minutes, creating a sense of superhuman capability.

However, the author identifies a subtle but dangerous shift that occurs around the three-month mark. Instead of using AI to amplify existing capabilities, users begin reaching for AI before engaging their own thinking. This creates a vicious cycle: the easier it becomes to get answers, the less inclined we are to develop the mental muscles needed for deep problem-solving. The author's observation about losing the ability to "sit with a hard problem for hours" resonates deeply with the current state of software development, where immediate solutions often take precedence over understanding.

The distinction between "outsourcing to AI" and "thinking with AI" represents a fundamental architectural decision for how we integrate these tools into our cognitive workflows. Outsourcing creates dependency and skill atrophy—you get immediate results but lose transferable knowledge. Thinking with AI, on the other hand, treats the tool as a sophisticated reasoning partner that helps you build frameworks and mental models you can apply independently.

For development teams and technical leaders, this insight has profound implications. The same pattern that affects individual productivity can scale to team dynamics, where junior developers might never develop critical thinking skills if they consistently outsource complex problems to AI. The challenge isn't avoiding AI—it's designing workflows that preserve and enhance human capability while leveraging AI's strengths.

The author's realization came through recognizing that AI doesn't inherently make you lazy; it simply removes friction from the path of least resistance. This friction, however uncomfortable, is often what builds expertise and deep understanding. The key is intentionally preserving the right kind of friction while eliminating genuinely wasteful overhead.

**Key takeaways:**
- AI productivity gains can mask cognitive skill degradation if not managed intentionally
- "Thinking with AI" builds capabilities while "outsourcing to AI" creates dependency
- The three-month mark appears to be a critical transition point where habits solidify
- Preserving productive friction is essential for long-term skill development

**Tradeoffs:**
- Immediate AI productivity gains but risk long-term cognitive dependency
- Faster task completion but potential loss of deep problem-solving abilities
- Reduced mental effort but weakened transferable skill development
