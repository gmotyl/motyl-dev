## Beyond Vibe Coding with Addy Osmani

**TLDR:** Addy Osmani, Head of Chrome Developer Experience at Google, discusses "The 70% Problem" - how AI coding tools excel at accelerating initial development but struggle with the final 30% of software quality that requires deep system understanding. He advocates for spec-driven development and maintaining low expectations but high control when using AI tools.

**Summary:**

This conversation with Addy Osmani reveals a nuanced perspective on AI's role in software development that cuts through the hype. Osmani introduces "The 70% Problem" - a framework suggesting that AI tools excel at generating the first 70% of code quickly, but the remaining 30% involving edge cases, performance optimization, security considerations, and deep system integration requires human expertise and institutional knowledge.

The discussion emphasizes a shift from "vibe coding" - the intuitive, exploratory approach to development - toward spec-driven development when working with AI tools. Osmani advocates for having clear plans and specifications before engaging AI assistants, treating them as powerful but limited tools that require careful oversight. This approach acknowledges that while AI can dramatically accelerate initial development, the quality and robustness that distinguish production systems from prototypes still depend on human understanding of system architecture and business requirements.

Particularly interesting is Osmani's emphasis on testing as a risk mitigation strategy when using AI-generated code. He argues that comprehensive test suites serve as guardrails, helping developers identify when AI-generated code goes "off the rails" and providing confidence in the generated solutions. This represents a pragmatic approach to AI adoption - embracing the productivity gains while maintaining quality controls through established engineering practices.

The conversation also touches on how AI tools might reshape traditional engineering roles, particularly for engineering managers and product managers. However, Osmani suggests that rather than replacing human judgment, these tools amplify the importance of understanding system design, performance implications, and the broader context in which code operates. For teams and architects, this reinforces the value of investing in foundational knowledge and system thinking, as these become the differentiating factors in an AI-augmented development environment.

**Key takeaways:**
- AI coding tools handle initial development well but struggle with the final 30% of software quality that requires deep system understanding
- Spec-driven development with clear plans works better than exploratory "vibe coding" when using AI tools
- Testing serves as crucial guardrails for validating AI-generated code and catching when solutions go off track

**Tradeoffs:**
- AI tools provide development speed but sacrifice the institutional knowledge and context that comes from writing code manually
- Spec-driven development increases upfront planning time but reduces the risk of AI-generated code going astray
