## Frontend Masters 2026 Workshop Calendar: Reading Between the Lines

**TLDR:** Frontend Masters dropped their 2026 workshop schedule featuring instructors from Netflix, Anthropic, Spotify, Vercel, and Databricks. While the email itself is promotional, the lineup is a fascinating barometer of where the industry thinks developers need to level up -- and AI engineering is clearly dominating the conversation.

**Summary:**

Look, I need to be upfront with you: this entire newsletter is essentially a sales pitch for Frontend Masters memberships at thirty-nine dollars a month. Marc Grabanski, the CEO, even leads with an anecdote about someone calling the pricing "a scam." That is marketing, plain and simple. But here is the thing -- the workshop lineup itself is genuinely interesting if you read it as a signal about where the industry is heading, and that is worth talking about.

Let us start with the elephant in the room: AI is everywhere in this schedule. You have got Scott Moss from Netflix teaching AI Engineering Fundamentals, Lydia Hallie from Anthropic doing a deep dive on Claude Code, a workshop on building custom agents with the Claude Code SDK, another on "Hard Parts of AI Engineering" from Codesmith, and yet another on automating development with self-testing AI agents. That is five AI-focused workshops out of roughly twenty. A quarter of the entire lineup. Two years ago, this would have been maybe one workshop, if that. The signal here is unmistakable: the industry has decided that AI engineering is not a specialty anymore, it is a core competency.

What is also telling is what they are pairing alongside the AI content. You have got Enterprise UI Dev covering microfrontends and code quality, Permission Systems that Scale going from role-based to attribute-based access control, and deploying SPAs on AWS. These are not beginner topics. This is the bread-and-butter architecture work that keeps production systems running. The juxtaposition suggests something important: the industry needs people who can build robust, scalable systems AND integrate AI into them. It is not one or the other.

Now, here is what I think is missing from this picture. There is no workshop on testing AI-generated code at scale. There is nothing about managing technical debt that AI coding assistants create. There is no content on the organizational and team dynamics of adopting AI tooling. The "Automate Dev with Self-Testing AI Agents" workshop touches on this, but the description focuses on Playwright and browser automation rather than the harder questions about code review workflows and quality gates when half your team's output is AI-assisted. These are the problems I am hearing about from engineering leaders right now, and nobody seems to be teaching them yet.

The inclusion of Rich Harris from Vercel teaching Svelte and SvelteKit 5+ is noteworthy. Svelte continues to carve out its niche as the framework for developers who want less JavaScript shipped to the browser, and having the framework creator himself do a two-day deep dive is the kind of thing that is hard to replicate with a blog post or documentation. Same goes for Adam Rackis from Spotify on TanStack Start -- this is a framework that is still emerging, and getting hands-on instruction from someone using it in production at a company like Spotify gives you insight you simply cannot get from a README.

One more thing worth noting: the expansion beyond pure frontend. You have got Python, Rails, Django, Kubernetes, databases, and CI/CD in here. Frontend Masters has been quietly broadening its scope for years, but this lineup makes it explicit. The name "Frontend Masters" is increasingly a misnomer, and that is probably a good thing. The modern developer needs to understand the full stack, and pretending otherwise does not serve anyone.

**Key takeaways:**

- AI engineering workshops represent roughly 25% of the 2026 lineup, signaling it has become a mainstream developer skill rather than a niche specialty
- The instructor roster draws from production engineers at Netflix, Anthropic, Spotify, Vercel, and Databricks, suggesting these companies see value in public developer education
- Enterprise architecture topics like microfrontends, permission systems, and AWS deployment remain prominent alongside AI content
- TanStack Start and Svelte/SvelteKit 5+ are getting dedicated multi-day workshops, indicating growing ecosystem maturity
- The lineup has expanded well beyond frontend into Python, databases, Kubernetes, and DevOps, reflecting the full-stack reality of modern development
- Missing from the conversation: managing AI-generated code quality at scale, organizational adoption of AI tooling, and the evolving role of code review

**Tradeoffs:** The all-you-can-eat subscription model at thirty-nine dollars a month makes workshops accessible, but it also means the business model depends on most subscribers not actually attending most workshops. This is the gym membership problem. The value proposition is strongest for developers who are disciplined enough to block out full days for live attendance and who work at companies willing to give them that time. For everyone else, the recorded versions lose the interactive Q&A component that makes live workshops distinctly valuable.
