## Building Apps with Your Voice
**TLDR:** Paige Bailey (Google DeepMind) showcases a live demo of building and deploying a functional application entirely through voice commands, signaling a shift in how engineers interact with code.

**Summary:** In this episode of Refactoring.fm, Paige Bailey, a lead at Google DeepMind and former GitHub PM, demonstrates the current state of voice-driven development. The demo involves creating an app that accesses the camera, performs image manipulation, and uses AI to conduct a live interview to fill out a user profile—all orchestrated through voice. This isn't just about speed; it's about a new layer of abstraction that allows for 'vibe-coding' to become production-ready.

The conversation touches on how the roles within engineering teams at places like Google DeepMind are converging. As AI handles more of the mechanical implementation, the distinction between product, design, and engineering becomes blurred. Engineers are moving toward being 'system orchestrators' rather than just 'code writers.' This requires a shift in identity and intuition-building for how to use these powerful models effectively.

Architecturally, this suggests that the future developer environment will be multi-modal. Voice and natural language will serve as the high-level orchestration layer, while traditional code remains the underlying implementation detail. Teams need to start thinking about how to integrate these 'agentic' workflows into their existing CI/CD pipelines and design systems.

**Key takeaways:**
- Voice-driven development is capable of building and deploying complex, multi-modal applications.
- Engineering roles are converging toward a single, unified 'orchestrator' role.
- Developing an 'AI intuition' is becoming as important as traditional technical skills.
