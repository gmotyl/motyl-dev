## How to Vibe-Code a Professional Presentation with Claude in Under 10 Minutes

**TLDR:** A Claude skill called Frontend Slides lets you generate complete, self-contained HTML presentations through conversation alone. It ships with 12 curated visual themes, outputs a single file you own with no subscriptions, and runs in any browser with keyboard navigation, swipe support, and animations.

**Summary:**

Here is something that resonated with me immediately. You get asked to "put together a few slides." The content? Easy. Making it look professional? That is an entirely different discipline. Most of us open PowerPoint, grab a default template, nudge some boxes around, and produce something that broadcasts "I spent twenty minutes on this." The AI Adopters Club newsletter tackles this exact pain point with a walkthrough of a Claude skill called Frontend Slides.

The core value proposition is straightforward: you describe what you want in natural language, and Claude generates a complete, self-contained HTML file. Not a Google Slides link. Not a Canva project. A single HTML file you open in any browser. It includes keyboard navigation, swipe support on mobile, scroll-snapping, and animated transitions. You own the output. No subscriptions. No build tools. No vendor lock-in.

What caught my attention is the approach to theming. The skill ships with 12 complete visual identities, and these are not just color palette swaps. Each theme bundles curated font pairings from Fontshare and Google Fonts, a full color system, and specific design elements. There is an explicit ban on the generic AI aesthetic -- no Inter, no Roboto, no purple gradients on white backgrounds. You can pick a theme by name, describe a mood like "premium and confident," or have Claude generate three mini previews you open in your browser before committing.

Now, here is where I want to push back a bit. The article sells this as a replacement for PowerPoint and Canva, but it does not address some real-world constraints. What about collaboration? If your team is in Google Slides or PowerPoint, a standalone HTML file creates friction. What about editing after the fact -- can a non-technical person tweak content without going back to Claude? The article also cuts off right as it is about to explain the installation process, which suggests the full setup instructions are gated behind a paid subscription. That is worth noting: the free version of this newsletter gives you the pitch, but the actual skill file and detailed walkthrough appear to be subscriber-only.

What the author avoids thinking about is the durability question. An HTML presentation with external font dependencies (Fontshare, Google Fonts) is not truly self-contained. If those CDNs go down or change, your presentation breaks. The article also does not discuss accessibility -- screen reader support, contrast ratios, reduced motion preferences. These matter for professional presentations, and calling something "designer-grade" without addressing them is a gap.

**Key takeaways:**
- Frontend Slides is a Claude skill that generates complete HTML presentations from natural language descriptions
- The output is a single self-contained HTML file with no vendor lock-in or subscriptions required
- 12 built-in themes go beyond color swaps, including curated font pairings and full design systems
- Themes can be selected by name, mood description, or visual preview
- The skill explicitly avoids generic AI aesthetics (no Inter, no Roboto, no default purple gradients)
- Browser-native features include keyboard navigation, swipe support, and scroll-snapping

**Tradeoffs:**
- Single HTML file ownership vs. team collaboration workflows (no real-time co-editing)
- External font CDN dependencies vs. true self-containment
- AI-generated design vs. hand-tuned accessibility compliance
- Conversational iteration vs. direct WYSIWYG editing for non-technical users
