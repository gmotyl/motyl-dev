## A Prompt Sequence Exposes the Weak Spots in Your Business

**TLDR:** A seven-prompt sequential diagnostic designed to surface entrepreneurial blind spots: the constraints you've normalized, the $20/hour work disguised as productivity, and the gap between what you think your business is and what customers actually experience.

Let me share something that resonates with every entrepreneur I've ever met: you can't see the constraints you're inside. Forbes research reveals a persistent productivity blind spot - 25% of entrepreneurs believe it's "faster to do it myself" even for low-value tasks. Many more waste time on what feels urgent rather than what's strategically important.

This newsletter presents a seven-prompt sequence that works as a compound diagnostic. The key word there is compound - running all seven prompts builds context progressively, and the insight comes from the accumulation, not any single prompt.

Here's what you get by the end: a method to find your actual customer (not the fictional one in your head), positioning that separates you from everyone who sounds like you, your primary bottleneck identified, and one priority for the next 90 days.

The workflow is elegant: start with prompt one, answer honestly, share documents and links when you have them. Each prompt ends with a summary. Copy that summary and paste it into the bracketed sections of the next prompt. Context builds as you go. By prompt seven, you have a complete diagnostic.

The first prompt sets the tone brilliantly. It positions the AI as a "brutally honest small business consultant who's audited 200+ solopreneurs and noticed they all lie to themselves about the same things." The job is to end that pattern. It gathers context about what you sell, who you sell to, revenue sources, how long you've operated, and what you think is working versus struggling.

Then it tears it apart with specific questions: Where are you confusing activity with progress? What's the gap between what you think your business is and what customers actually experience? If the AI had 60 seconds to tell you what's really going on, what would it say?

For architects and technical leaders, this methodology is applicable beyond business diagnostics. The same compound prompt structure could be adapted for technical debt assessment, team health diagnostics, or architecture review processes. The key principles translate: honest context gathering, progressive summarization, explicit confrontation of blind spots, and convergence on prioritized action.

The practical tips are worth noting: use one chat thread per prompt to keep context clean, don't skip ahead because the sequence matters, and when prompted to share documents, actually share them. Website copy, analytics, customer emails - more context means sharper diagnosis. And critically: if a summary feels wrong, push back before moving on. The AI should defend or revise.

**Key takeaways:**
- Entrepreneurs normalize constraints they can't see because they're inside them
- Sequential prompts build compound insight that no single prompt can achieve
- The methodology forces confrontation of blind spots through honest context + brutal feedback
- 60-90 minutes investment yields a 90-day priority and complete diagnostic
- Push back on summaries that feel wrong - demand defense or revision

**Tradeoffs:**
- Deep honest engagement yields meaningful insights but requires vulnerability and time
- Sequential structure ensures compound insight but prevents cherry-picking prompts
