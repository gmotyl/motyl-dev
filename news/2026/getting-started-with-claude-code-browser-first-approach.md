## Tutorial: How To Start With Claude Code (The Easiest Way)

**TLDR:** Claude Code has become a hot topic in the developer and creator community, but getting started can feel intimidating for non-technical users. This tutorial from The AI Break newsletter walks you through the simplest entry point: using Claude Code directly in your browser via claude.ai, with nothing more than a paid Claude account and a free GitHub account.

**Summary:**

Look, there is a pattern I have seen over and over again throughout my career in technology. A powerful new tool comes along, everyone gets excited, and then half the people who could genuinely benefit from it bounce off during setup. Claude Code is experiencing exactly that moment right now. People hear about it, they want to try it, and then they see the word "terminal" and their eyes glaze over. This tutorial from Luis and Rui at The AI Break newsletter tackles that exact friction point head-on, and I think their approach is spot-on.

The core insight here is deceptively simple: you do not need to start with the terminal. You do not need Visual Studio Code. You do not even need to know what a command line is. Claude Code is available directly in your browser at claude.ai, and that is where beginners should start. The requirements are refreshingly minimal: a paid Claude account (the Pro plan at twenty dollars a month) and a free GitHub account. That is it. The authors frame GitHub nicely as "Google Drive, but for code," which is the kind of analogy that actually helps people who are not steeped in developer culture understand what they are signing up for.

What I find particularly thoughtful about this approach is the emphasis on safety and simplicity. The browser version of Claude Code connects only to GitHub. It has no access to your local machine, your files, or your folders. For someone who is just getting their feet wet, that sandboxed environment is exactly the right level of exposure. You get to experience the power of an AI coding agent without the anxiety of wondering whether it is going to rearrange your desktop or accidentally delete something important. That is a genuinely responsible way to introduce people to agentic AI tools.

The article also does something I wish more tutorials did: it acknowledges the full spectrum of options (terminal, IDE integration, desktop app, browser) while being very clear about which one is right for which audience. Too many getting-started guides assume everyone is at the same level, and that is how you end up with frustrated beginners and bored experts. The progression path here is sensible: start in the browser, get comfortable with the concepts, and then graduate to the terminal or Visual Studio Code when you are ready for more power and flexibility.

For teams and architects thinking about how to introduce AI-powered coding tools across an organization, this browser-first approach has real implications. You could onboard product managers, designers, or junior team members with Claude Code without needing to set up development environments on their machines. The GitHub-only sandbox model means IT departments can feel more comfortable approving access. It lowers the barrier to entry dramatically, which is exactly what you want when you are trying to build AI literacy across a whole team rather than just among your senior engineers.

**Key takeaways:**

- Claude Code is accessible directly from your browser at claude.ai, requiring only a paid Claude account and a free GitHub account to get started
- The browser version is sandboxed to GitHub only, with no access to local files or folders, making it the safest entry point for beginners
- There are four ways to use Claude Code (terminal, IDE, desktop app, browser), and the tutorial recommends the browser as the right starting point for non-technical users
- The setup takes under fifteen minutes and requires zero coding experience
- Once comfortable with the browser version, users can graduate to terminal or Visual Studio Code for more advanced capabilities
