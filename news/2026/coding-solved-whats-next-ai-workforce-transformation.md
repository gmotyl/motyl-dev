## Coding Is Solved. What's Next?

**TLDR:** AI has fundamentally transformed coding with a 30-60% speed improvement, but the real story is understanding that AI doesn't replace jobs—it handles specific tasks. By mapping work into granular tasks and identifying which ones to delegate to AI, professionals in office administration, professional services, and finance are next in line for transformation.

**Summary:**

The transformation of software engineering through AI is complete. Claude Code reached a billion-dollar valuation in six months, GitHub Copilot has 1.8 million paying subscribers, and modern AI models autonomously fix 80% of real software bugs. But here's the critical insight that gets lost in the hype: AI doesn't replace software engineers. It makes them 30-60% faster by handling specific coding tasks better than humans can.

This distinction between jobs and tasks is foundational. AI doesn't replace a "software developer"—it handles specific tasks like "fix bugs in existing software" far more efficiently. The same applies across every profession. It doesn't replace consultants or administrative assistants; it handles specific components of their work. The Anthropic Economic Index, mapping a million real AI conversations to 3,500 individual tasks, proves that AI is extraordinarily capable at specific tasks but unable to complete entire jobs.

What's fascinating is the concentration of AI usage. The top 100 tasks account for half of all AI usage, while the remaining 3,400 tasks barely register. This matters for your business because it means you should stop asking whether AI will replace your team and start asking which parts of your work you should delegate to AI and which you should do yourself.

The gap between AI's demo performance and real-world results tells a sobering story. On clean, isolated expert tasks, AI scores 74%. On multi-step professional tasks, performance drops to 30%. On actual freelance projects from Upwork, it scores just 3.75%. Yet even with this inconsistency, AI achieves a remarkable 12x speedup—completing AI-assisted tasks in 15 minutes instead of 3 hours with a 67% success rate. The math still works because most tasks don't require perfect execution, they require fast iteration.

Now, if coding fell first, which sectors follow? The data points to three frontrunners. Office and administrative work is most exposed. Google Gemini edited 1.4 billion documents in the first half of 2025. Microsoft Copilot handles email drafts, meeting recaps, and spreadsheet work across 15 million enterprise seats. Data entry, transcription, and routine correspondence are being automated simultaneously. Customer service work, driven by improving autonomous voice agents, is following close behind. If your team spends hours on meeting notes, email drafts, or information synthesis, it's time to delegate today.

Professional services—consulting, legal, accounting—are next. AI drafts legal briefs, generates financial models, and produces research summaries at 5-10x the speed of junior professionals. The catch is that on multi-step tasks, AI succeeds about 30% of the time. Good enough to accelerate work, but nowhere near good enough to eliminate the professional. Financial services will follow, with the full impact probably arriving in late 2027 due to regulatory complexity. Healthcare and finance showed 3.4x growth in Gemini adoption in 2025, driven by documentation and compliance monitoring.

The pattern is consistent: AI takes the execution layer while humans handle judgment, client relationships, and final decisions. For many tasks, a 90% correct AI draft is economically indistinguishable from a human-written one. An AI meeting summary capturing 90% of nuances? Junior team members are relieved they're done with that chore. An AI document translation in seconds instead of weeks? The 12x speedup dwarfs the occasional human correction needed.

But there's a category of work where humans aren't just valuable—they're the product. Consultants, coaches, advisors, and founders live here. This is human alpha territory. Your judgment under ambiguity is irreplaceable. When clients come to you with messy situations, they're paying for your read on things. AI can summarize the data, but it can't tell them which strategic bet to make. The 74% versus 3.75% performance gap exists precisely because real work is ambiguous.

Your accountability matters. AI can draft the proposal, but someone has to stake their reputation on it. Your relationships matter too—client management and trust-building show the lowest AI automation potential of any category at just 4.4%. Most critically, your ability to frame the right problem is what separates professionals from tools. AI can solve problems, but you decide which ones matter. This is the most underrated skill in an AI-augmented world.

The data reveals something powerful: there's a near-perfect statistical correlation (r > 0.92) between the expertise needed to write the prompt and the quality of AI's response. You need deep understanding of the work to delegate it effectively. AI doesn't reduce the need for expertise—it shifts where expertise gets applied, from execution to direction and evaluation.

But there's a cost that the headlines miss. The supervision tax—the time spent reviewing, correcting, and refining AI output—cuts expected productivity gains nearly in half. Anthropic's estimate of 1.8 percentage points annual productivity boost drops to 1.0 when human correction time is factored in. One in three AI task completions still needs correction. This is why, after three years of ChatGPT, 900 million weekly users, and two trillion dollars in global AI spending, macro data hasn't shown AI's impact yet. The supervision tax plus organizational adoption time is absorbing much of the theoretical gains.

This creates a specific window of advantage for early movers. Organizations that learn to decompose their work into tasks, identify which ones AI handles well, and build review processes around the rest will compound advantages that become harder to catch up to. The meta-skill isn't mastering any specific AI tool. It's learning to delegate effectively.

For teams and architects considering AI integration, the question becomes: which tasks in your workflow can be confidently delegated with a simple review process, and which ones require human expertise to frame properly? Start with administrative and operational tasks where 90% accuracy is acceptable. Build your systems to handle the supervision tax rather than trying to eliminate it. Most importantly, understand that your value shifts from doing to directing. The real cost is shifting from execution to knowing what to build, and this applies across every knowledge-intensive profession.

**Key takeaways:**

- AI has solved coding not by replacing developers but by handling specific tasks 30-60% faster, establishing a replicable pattern for other sectors
- Work should be analyzed at the task level, not the job level—AI excels at specific components but can't handle complete, ambiguous projects
- Office and administrative work is most exposed to immediate AI transformation, followed by professional services and financial services later in 2026-2027
- A 67% success rate is economically viable when work completes 12x faster, but the supervision tax (time spent correcting AI output) cuts productivity gains nearly in half
- Human value concentrates in four areas: judgment under ambiguity, accountability, client relationships, and problem framing—AI shifts expertise from execution to direction

**Tradeoffs:**

- Gain 12x speed and 100x cost reduction on specific tasks but sacrifice execution quality (30% success on complex tasks) requiring supervision and correction time
- Delegate operational and routine work but maintain human control on judgment-heavy, ambiguous, and client-facing decisions where reputation and accountability matter
- Build AI-assisted workflows with early-mover advantages but invest in supervision processes and organizational adaptation that consume half of the theoretical productivity gains
