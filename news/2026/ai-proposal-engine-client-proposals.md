## Tutorial: Close Clients 2x Faster With AI (Proposal Engine)

**TLDR:** Most proposals fail because they're generic. This tutorial presents a prompt-based system to turn discovery call notes into structured, client-ready proposals. The key insight: a proposal is a "decision device" that must prove you understand the problem before presenting solutions.

The core problem with most proposals is they jump straight to deliverables without demonstrating insight. Clients want to see that you understand their situation before they trust your plan. The five things an effective proposal must do: restate the client's situation better than they can, diagnose the real bottleneck (not symptoms), present a simple plan with milestones, define scope clearly, and make the next step feel obvious.

The system breaks down into three sequential prompts. First, the diagnosis prompt transforms raw discovery notes into a structured analysis: executive summary, current situation, key challenges ranked by priority, root cause diagnosis, opportunities (quick wins and strategic wins), and success metrics. The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to write like a real consultant without buzzwords.

Second, the strategy prompt takes that diagnosis and creates proposal-ready strategy pillars. Each pillar includes what you'll do, why it matters, and expected impact. It adds a timeline overview and assumptions that must be true for the plan to work. A useful addition: including "what we're NOT doing" to increase trust and reduce scope creep later.

Third, the scope prompt converts strategy into clear deliverables with responsibilities and exclusions. This is where proposals typically create problems - vague scope leads to misunderstandings and scope creep. The goal is deliverables that are clear, measurable, and hard to misunderstand.

For architects and teams doing client work, this system addresses a real workflow pain point. Discovery calls generate messy, unstructured notes. Turning those into professional proposals typically takes hours of synthesis and formatting. The prompt chain provides a repeatable structure that maintains consistency across proposals while still feeling custom to each client. The key is feeding the AI enough context from the discovery call - the output quality directly reflects input quality.

**Key takeaways:**
- Proposals fail when they jump to deliverables without proving understanding of the problem
- Structure proposals as: diagnosis → strategy → scope with clear deliverables
- Include "what we're NOT doing" to build trust and prevent scope creep
- Define measurable success metrics so results are unambiguous
- Make the next step obvious and low-friction to increase close rates

**Tradeoffs:**
- AI-generated proposals gain speed and consistency but risk losing the nuanced understanding that comes from manual synthesis
- Templated prompt structure ensures completeness but requires quality input from discovery calls to produce quality output
