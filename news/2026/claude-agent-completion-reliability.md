## Claude Finally Finishes What He Starts
**TLDR:** A major hurdle for AI agents has been the tendency to stop midway through complex tasks. New model refinements have addressed this 'agentic fatigue,' allowing for more reliable completion of multi-step engineering projects.

**Summary:** Developers using agentic frameworks like OpenClaw or Claude Code have long complained about the '80% problem'—the AI gets most of the way through a task but fails to cross the finish line. This often resulted from context window management or simple 'reasoning drift.' The latest refinements to the Claude 4.x series have specifically targeted this behavior. The models are now better at tracking original objectives across dozens of tool-calling turns.

This improvement is particularly evident in large-scale codebase migrations or documentation audits. Where previous agents might have updated three files and then 'lost the thread,' the new version can systematically work through entire directories without manual intervention. This reliability is the foundation for moving AI from a 'co-pilot' (requiring constant oversight) to a 'pilot' (operating independently with review at the end).

Architecturally, this means teams can start automating more of their 'toil'—the repetitive but necessary tasks like version bumps, dependency updates, and boilerplate generation. The increase in model 'stamina' significantly lowers the barrier for adopting agent-based CI/CD workflows.

**Key takeaways:**
- Model updates have significantly reduced 'agentic fatigue.'
- AI agents are now more reliable for multi-step, end-to-end tasks.
- Reliability is shifting the AI role from 'assistant' to 'autonomous pilot.'
