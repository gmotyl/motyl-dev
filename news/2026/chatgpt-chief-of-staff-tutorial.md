## Turn ChatGPT Into Your Chief of Staff
**TLDR:** This tutorial outlines a framework for using AI to manage high-level executive functions, including calendar optimization, email triage, and project prioritization, in a fraction of the usual time.

**Summary:** The 'Chief of Staff' model for AI goes beyond simple task management. It involves feeding the model your priorities, your constraints, and your incoming data (emails, meeting notes, slack pings) and having it synthesize a coherent plan for the week. The key to success isn't just the prompt, but the 'recursive feedback' loop where the AI identifies conflicts and proposes trade-offs.

A critical part of this workflow is the '30-minute weekly review.' By providing the LLM with a snapshot of your calendar and your 'done' list from the previous week, it can identify patterns of inefficiency and help you reclaim time. For example, it might notice that you have too many back-to-back deep-work sessions and suggest breaks, or identify a recurring meeting that could be handled asynchronously.

For engineering leads and architects, this isn't just a personal productivity hack. It's a template for 'human-in-the-loop' automation. By teaching an AI your 'mental model' for prioritization, you're essentially building a personalized agent that can represent your interests in lower-level decision-making processes.

**Key takeaways:**
- AI can act as a high-level 'Chief of Staff' for complex decision-making and planning.
- The 30-minute weekly review is the core mechanism for maintaining alignment.
- This workflow is a model for delegating executive function to agentic systems.
