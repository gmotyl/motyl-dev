## Agent Psychosis: Are We Going Insane?

**TLDR:** AI coding agents are creating a dangerous productivity illusion where developers become addicted to quick code generation while actually burdening maintainers with low-quality contributions that take hours to review.

There's something genuinely troubling happening in our industry right now, and it's time we talked about it honestly. AI coding agents have created what can only be described as a productivity paradox - developers are getting that sweet dopamine hit from rapid code generation while simultaneously creating a maintenance nightmare for everyone downstream.

Here's the fundamental problem: generating code with an AI agent takes minutes. Reviewing that code properly? Hours. This asymmetry is absolutely crushing open source maintainers. They're drowning in pull requests that look impressive at first glance but often contain subtle bugs, inconsistent patterns, or outright architectural violations that only become apparent after careful human analysis.

What concerns me most is the psychological component. We're seeing developers develop what amounts to an addiction - that satisfaction of watching an agent produce hundreds of lines of code is intoxicating. But it's a false productivity signal. The real work hasn't been done yet. The thinking hasn't happened. The understanding hasn't formed. We've essentially outsourced the enjoyable part of programming (the creation) while exponentially multiplying the tedious part (the review).

For teams and architects, this demands a rethinking of code review processes. You cannot apply the same review timeline expectations to AI-generated code. Consider implementing mandatory cooling-off periods, requiring detailed explanations of why specific approaches were chosen, and perhaps most importantly, training reviewers to spot the telltale signs of AI-generated code that hasn't been properly understood by its submitter.

**Key takeaways:**
- AI code generation creates asymmetric time costs: minutes to generate, hours to review
- Developers risk developing dopamine-driven addiction to agent-assisted coding
- Open source maintainers face unprecedented burden from low-quality contributions
- Teams need new review processes specifically designed for AI-generated code

**Tradeoffs:**
- Gain rapid initial code generation but sacrifice code comprehension and ownership
- Increased contribution volume comes at the cost of maintainer burnout

## wtf is going on with ChatGPT?

**TLDR:** OpenAI launched ChatGPT Go at $8/month with ads globally, responding to Gemini's dramatic market share growth from 15% to 40% while OpenAI dropped from 75-85% to around 60%.

The AI assistant market just got significantly more interesting. OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT Go globally - an $8/month subscription tier that includes advertising. Yes, you read that correctly. OpenAI is now running ads. After initially testing this in India, they've gone worldwide with the offering.

Why would OpenAI do this? The numbers tell the story. Google's Gemini has been eating their lunch, growing from roughly 15% market share to a whopping 40%. Meanwhile, OpenAI has watched their dominance erode from somewhere between 75-85% down to around 60%. That's a massive shift in a relatively short timeframe, and it explains the somewhat desperate-feeling pricing strategy.

This is classic market dynamics playing out in real-time. When you're the dominant player watching a well-funded competitor close the gap rapidly, you have two choices: innovate faster or compete on price and accessibility. OpenAI is clearly choosing the latter with this tier. The ad-supported model allows them to capture users who found the full subscription price prohibitive while still generating revenue.

For architects evaluating enterprise AI strategies, this market turbulence is actually good news. Competition drives innovation and typically pushes prices down. However, it also introduces uncertainty about which platforms will maintain support and development investment long-term. The smart play is to abstract your AI integrations behind clean interfaces that allow for provider switching without massive refactoring.

**Key takeaways:**
- ChatGPT Go offers $8/month tier with advertising globally
- Gemini grew from ~15% to ~40% market share, pressuring OpenAI
- OpenAI dropped from 75-85% to ~60% market share
- Competition is driving more accessible pricing models

**Tradeoffs:**
- Lower price accessibility comes at the cost of ad interruptions and potential privacy considerations
- Broader market competition increases innovation but creates platform stability uncertainty
