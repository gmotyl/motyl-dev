## Anthropic vs. OpenAI, the Pre-IPO Days

**TLDR:** Anthropic is growing revenue at roughly twice the pace of OpenAI and is on track to overtake it in annual recurring revenue by late 2026. Both companies are preparing for massive IPOs, but their strategic execution and enterprise focus tell very different stories about who will dominate the next era of AI.

**Summary:**

We are living through what might be the most consequential moment in AI business history. Anthropic just closed a 30 billion dollar funding round, while OpenAI is working to close its own 100 billion dollar round, with Nvidia reportedly in discussions to invest up to 30 billion in OpenAI at a valuation that could reach 850 billion dollars pre-money. Both companies, along with SpaceX, are expected to IPO at or above a one trillion dollar market cap. These are staggering numbers, but the underlying dynamics tell a more nuanced story than just raw valuations.

The revenue growth trajectories are where things get genuinely interesting, and where I think the author nails the core insight. Anthropic has been growing at roughly 7x per year since mid-2025, compared to OpenAI's more modest pace. Epoch AI projects that Anthropic will overtake OpenAI in annual recurring revenue sometime in late 2026. Even as both companies expect slower growth this year, with OpenAI projecting 2.2x growth and Anthropic projecting 4x or less, that gap in velocity is enormous. When you compound those differences over time, the picture shifts dramatically. The article cites Ramp data showing that one in five businesses now pays for Anthropic, up from one in twenty-five just a year ago. Meanwhile, 79 percent of Anthropic's customers are already OpenAI customers, which tells you the enterprise market is actively evaluating alternatives and in many cases running both.

What the article correctly identifies but could push harder on is the strategic differentiation. Anthropic is winning the developer and enterprise trust game. Claude Code momentum, the Model Context Protocol becoming what the article calls the "USB-C for AI," and a relentless focus on agentic workflows are creating a moat that goes beyond model quality. OpenAI, meanwhile, has been spreading itself thin: consumer products, hardware ambitions, video generation with Sora, and a complicated financial arrangement paying 20 percent of revenue to Microsoft until 2032. That last point deserves more scrutiny than the article gives it. Handing a fifth of your top line to a partner for the next six years is a structural drag on profitability that Anthropic simply does not face.

One thing the author dances around but does not quite confront directly is the profitability timeline. Anthropic is projected to be profitable as soon as 2028, while OpenAI might not reach that mark until 2031. For companies heading into public markets, that delta is massive. Public market investors will eventually demand a path to profitability, and the company that gets there first will have a significant advantage in sustaining its valuation. The article also mentions that ByteDance's Seedance looks more impressive than Sora, and that Google's Gemini CLI is gaining on Codex. These are not small data points. They suggest that OpenAI's first-mover advantage is eroding on multiple fronts simultaneously.

For architects and engineering leaders, the practical implication here is clear: building your AI strategy around a single provider is increasingly risky. The competitive landscape is fragmenting rapidly, with Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, ByteDance, xAI, and DeepSeek all pushing forward. The emergence of MCP as a standardized protocol for agentic AI interactions is the kind of infrastructure decision that teams should be paying attention to now. If you are evaluating AI integrations for enterprise workflows, the smart move is designing for portability and multi-provider support, because the winner of this race is far from decided.

**Key takeaways:**

- Anthropic is on pace to overtake OpenAI in annual recurring revenue by late 2026, growing at roughly twice the rate despite both companies expecting slower growth this year
- One in five businesses on the Ramp platform now pays for Anthropic, up from one in twenty-five a year ago, and 79 percent of Anthropic's customers are already OpenAI customers
- OpenAI's obligation to pay 20 percent of revenue to Microsoft until 2032 is a significant structural disadvantage in the race to profitability
- The Model Context Protocol is becoming a de facto standard for agentic AI, positioning Anthropic as the infrastructure layer for enterprise automation
- Anthropic is projected to reach profitability by 2028, potentially three years ahead of OpenAI

**Tradeoffs:**

- Anthropic's enterprise-first, developer-focused strategy builds deeper moats but sacrifices the massive consumer brand awareness that OpenAI enjoys through ChatGPT
- OpenAI's diversification into hardware, video, and consumer products broadens the total addressable market but dilutes engineering focus and delays profitability
- Building on MCP as a standardized protocol enables ecosystem growth and developer adoption but creates dependency on a protocol controlled by a single company
