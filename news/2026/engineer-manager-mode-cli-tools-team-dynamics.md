## CLI Tools, Bringing Problems, the Forest, and the Desert

**TLDR:** CLI tools encourage "manager mode" thinking that focuses on orchestration and flow rather than code details, while the cultural divide between "forest" teams (collaborative, flexible) and "desert" teams (strict processes, limited resources) explains why modernization efforts often fail across organizations.

**Summary:**

The distinction between IDE-first and CLI-first development environments is more than a preference—it represents a fundamental shift in how developers interact with their work. IDEs default to "engineer mode," presenting 70% of the interface dedicated to traditional coding concerns: file management, code editing, terminals. This cognitive default keeps developers in the trees, focused on implementation details. CLI tools, by contrast, default to "manager mode," where the focus shifts to orchestration, sequencing, and the big picture.

This distinction matters more than ever in the era of AI-assisted development. The most successful developers using tools like Claude Code and Cursor aren't those who treat AI as a code-generation button, but those who manage the AI as a tool—breaking down problems, guiding the tool, reviewing its output, and adjusting direction. This requires manager-level thinking: understanding the end goal, breaking it into actionable steps, and coordinating execution. CLI tools naturally support this cognitive pattern because they force developers to express intent as a sequence of actions rather than diving into implementation details.

The cultural insight about problems versus solutions reflects an even deeper organizational challenge. Many engineers fear surfacing problems without ready solutions, but this creates a dangerous environment where leaders remain blind to issues until they become crises. However, the solution is not passive problem-surfacing—it's presenting problems alongside thoughtful approaches to solving them. This skill improves only through practice and feedback. Engineers who develop the habit of proposing solutions to problems they identify become invaluable to their organizations because they combine situational awareness with constructive thinking.

The forest versus desert metaphor elegantly captures why organizational change initiatives often fail catastrophically. Teams working in the forest operate with trust, flexibility, and incremental progress. They ship faster not through heroic effort but through psychological safety and sustainable practices. Teams in the desert operate in survival mode with strict processes, minimal resources, and constant pressure. The tragedy is that people from desert teams cannot imagine how forest teams function—they interpret flexibility as chaos, and incremental progress as lack of urgency. This fundamental incomprehension means desert teams reject practices proven in forest environments as "soft" or "not applicable to our context."

**Key takeaways:**

- CLI tools promote manager mode thinking, helping developers coordinate AI assistance and complex projects more effectively
- IDE-first development defaults to engineer mode, potentially limiting effectiveness with AI-assisted workflows
- Presenting problems alongside proposed solutions develops over time and requires practice and organizational feedback
- Forest and desert teams operate in fundamentally different realities; knowledge transfer between them is exceptionally difficult

**Tradeoffs:**

- Gain: CLI tools enable better orchestration and manager-mode thinking but sacrifice immediate code visibility and familiar IDE workflows
- Gain: Teams in the forest move faster with flexibility and trust but sacrifice the rigid safety nets that protect desert-mode teams from chaos
- Gain: Proposing solutions develops better engineers but initially exposes them to more feedback and potential rejection
