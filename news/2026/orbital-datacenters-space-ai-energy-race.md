## Why Scaling AI is Underestimated: Orbital Datacenters, Lunar Energy, and the Space Infrastructure Race

**TLDR:** The AI Supremacy newsletter argues that terrestrial energy infrastructure cannot keep up with exponentially growing AI compute demands, and that orbital datacenters powered by space-based solar energy are not just science fiction but an emerging infrastructure race. SpaceX, Blue Origin, Google, and China are all positioning themselves as players in what could become the most consequential infrastructure buildout in human history.

**Summary:**

Let me paint you a picture of where we are right now. Global datacenter capacity sits at roughly 110 to 120 gigawatts. The industry expects to hit 200 gigawatts by 2030. In 2026 alone, developers are spending over 280 billion dollars just on physical facility shells, power systems, and cooling infrastructure. And here is the uncomfortable truth that this piece forces you to confront: the bottlenecks are not just about chips or talent. They are about energy, and specifically about the fundamental limitations of generating enough power on Earth to feed the exponential demand curve for AI compute. Power dedicated to AI is expected to skyrocket from roughly 9,500 megawatts today to over 100,000 megawatts by 2030. Now imagine needing 100 or even 1,000 times that. The math simply does not work with terrestrial infrastructure alone.

The article walks through an extensive analysis of why orbital datacenters are moving from theoretical to plausible. The core argument is straightforward: space-based solar panels generate up to five to eight times more power than ground-based ones because there is no atmosphere, no clouds, no day-night cycle to deal with, and no need for expensive battery storage. You eliminate the cooling problem that plagues terrestrial datacenters in warmer climates. You bypass the five-to-seven-year wait times for high-voltage utility hookups in major hubs like Northern Virginia and Phoenix. You sidestep community opposition to datacenter construction and the permitting nightmare that has become a genuine strategic bottleneck for AI scaling.

The competitive landscape here is fascinating and worth paying close attention to. SpaceX, fresh off its merger with xAI, is filing FCC paperwork for a constellation of one million satellites designed to host AI compute, essentially turning the Starlink shell into a global supercomputer. Blue Origin quietly announced TeraWave in January 2026, a 5,400-satellite network specifically for datacenters and government, with deployment starting in Q4 2027. They have a potentially underrated advantage: native AWS integration through Snowcone devices and Greengrass software, plus New Glenn's larger fairing allows them to launch bigger, more cooling-intensive server modules. Starcloud, formerly Lumen Orbit, is planning an 88,000-satellite constellation for AI datacenters. Google has Project Suncatcher for solar-powered satellite computing platforms. And China's state-owned CASC has made orbital datacenters part of its five-year plan. This is not one company's fever dream. This is a multi-player infrastructure race.

For architects and engineering leaders, the implications ripple far beyond space technology. If orbital compute becomes viable even at modest scale, the entire economics of cloud computing shifts. The current hyperscaler oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud could face genuine disruption from vertically integrated players like SpaceX that control both the launch capability and the compute infrastructure. The article names a new wave of potential hyperscalers: SpaceX, Anthropic, OpenAI, ByteDance, CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nscale, and Nebius. Think about what that means for your multi-cloud strategy, your vendor lock-in assumptions, and your cost projections for the next decade. The per-token cost of inference could drop by an order of magnitude if space-based compute delivers on even half of these promises.

Now, here is what this article is avoiding thinking about, and it is significant. The piece is almost entirely bullish on the thesis with very little rigorous examination of the failure modes. Latency is barely mentioned. Orbital datacenters at 500 to 2,000 kilometers altitude introduce meaningful round-trip latency that makes them unsuitable for many real-time AI inference workloads. The article glosses over the Kessler Syndrome risk, where a chain reaction of satellite collisions could render entire orbital shells unusable, which becomes catastrophic when your compute infrastructure lives there. Maintenance and hardware replacement in orbit is orders of magnitude more expensive and complex than swapping out GPUs in a terrestrial datacenter. The piece also takes Musk's timelines at face value, including claims like 10,000 to 30,000 Starship launches per year within a few years, which deserves far more scrutiny given his historical track record on timeline projections. The capital requirements are staggering and the article never seriously models the economics of whether the cost per compute unit actually pencils out when you factor in launch costs, space-hardened hardware premiums, orbital maintenance, and the engineering complexity of managing distributed computing across thousands of satellites.

**Key takeaways:**

- Terrestrial energy infrastructure faces a fundamental scaling wall for AI compute, with permitting delays, grid constraints, and community opposition creating multi-year bottlenecks
- Space-based solar delivers five to eight times more power per panel than ground-based alternatives, with no batteries, no cooling overhead, and no day-night cycle inefficiencies
- Blue Origin's TeraWave network with native AWS integration may be more strategically positioned than SpaceX for enterprise AI compute, despite SpaceX's first-mover advantage in launch cadence
- China has made orbital datacenters part of its official five-year space plan, signaling this is becoming a geopolitical infrastructure race, not just a commercial one
- The current hyperscaler market structure could be fundamentally disrupted within a decade if space-based compute becomes viable at scale
- Latency constraints, Kessler Syndrome risk, orbital maintenance costs, and Musk's historically optimistic timelines are critical risk factors the article underweights

**Tradeoffs:**

The central architectural tradeoff is throughput versus latency. Orbital datacenters could deliver massive throughput advantages for batch AI training and non-real-time inference workloads, but the physics of orbital altitude introduces latency that makes them unsuitable for latency-sensitive applications. Organizations will likely need hybrid architectures: terrestrial edge compute for real-time inference and orbital compute for training and batch processing. There is also a sovereignty tradeoff worth considering. Satellites in orbit do not respect national boundaries the way terrestrial datacenters do, which creates both opportunities for global scale and challenges for data residency compliance. Finally, the concentration risk of putting critical compute infrastructure in orbit, where a single debris cascade event could cause catastrophic and potentially irreversible damage, represents a fundamentally different risk profile than geographically distributed terrestrial datacenters.
