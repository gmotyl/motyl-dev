## Your AI Rollout Is Not Failing -- It Is Following a Pattern

**TLDR:** When organizations deploy AI, productivity typically drops before it climbs -- a phenomenon Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson calls the "productivity J-curve." Siemens' experience in their Erlangen electronics factory illustrates both the pain and the payoff: a 25 percent cut in reactive maintenance time, but only after navigating a difficult adoption dip that most leadership teams fail to anticipate.

**Summary:**

There is a particular kind of frustration that comes from investing heavily in something and watching the numbers go in the wrong direction. That is exactly what happens to most organizations when they start rolling out AI. It is not a sign that something broke. It is actually a well-documented pattern, and understanding it might be the difference between abandoning a winning strategy and seeing it through.

The story from Siemens' electronics factory in Erlangen, Germany, paints a vivid picture. A maintenance technician is standing in front of a machine at two in the morning, staring at a flashing error code. The machine produces over a thousand product variants. The one person in the entire facility who knows this specific fault is at home, asleep. The manual runs four hundred pages. Production stops. Across manufacturing broadly, machines sit idle an average of 800 hours per year, and in automotive specifically, a single hour of downtime can run past two million dollars. That is the cost of the old playbook: wait until morning, eat the loss, file an incident report that nobody reads.

The new playbook looks different. The technician opens an AI assistant on a shop-floor tablet, types a question in plain language, and gets step-by-step guidance pulled from machine manuals, error logs, and safety specifications. The line is running again in minutes. Erik Schwulera, Siemens' lead data analytics and AI specialist, captured the philosophy perfectly: "Instead of sending the right person, we make the person who is there the right person." The early results showed a 25 percent reduction in reactive maintenance time.

But here is the part that does not make it into the slide deck. Getting to that 25 percent improvement was not a straight line upward. Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson describes what happens as the "productivity J-curve." When a company adopts AI, the first measurable phase is not a gain -- it is a loss. Retraining takes hours away from productive output. Existing processes break before new ones solidify. Workers feel exposed and uncertain. Confidence drops. Measured productivity actually falls, even while the investment is quietly building capacity underneath the surface.

This is the part that kills most AI initiatives. Leadership sees the dip, panics, and pulls funding. But organizations like Siemens that understand the pattern going in -- that budget for the dip, plan for the temporary slowdown, and keep their nerve -- are the ones that come out the other side with genuine, measurable improvements. The J-curve is not a bug in AI adoption. It is a feature. And the sooner organizations accept that the path to transformation runs through a valley of reduced productivity, the better equipped they will be to actually reach the summit.

**Key takeaways:**

- AI adoption follows a predictable "productivity J-curve" where performance drops before it improves -- this is normal, not a sign of failure
- Siemens achieved a 25 percent reduction in reactive maintenance time by deploying AI assistants that turn any technician into the "right person" for the job
- Manufacturing machines sit idle an average of 800 hours per year; in automotive, one hour of downtime costs over two million dollars
- The biggest risk in AI adoption is not the technology failing -- it is leadership losing nerve during the inevitable productivity dip
- Organizations that budget for the dip and plan for temporary slowdowns are the ones that reach measurable gains on the other side
