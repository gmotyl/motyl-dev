## How to Use NotebookLM with Claude Code

**TLDR:** NotebookLM is Google's RAG-based AI that only answers from your uploaded documents with citations. Combined with Claude Code, it creates a powerful workflow: learn deeply in NotebookLM, then execute precisely in Claude Code. The separation prevents context rot and makes you a more effective AI collaborator.

The core insight here is deceptively simple but profound: your AI coding assistant is only as good as the instructions you give it. And your instructions are only as good as your understanding. NotebookLM helps you build that understanding before you start building anything.

NotebookLM operates as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Upload PDFs, Google Docs, websites, YouTube videos - it indexes everything. When you ask questions, it retrieves relevant passages and generates responses grounded in your sources, not the internet's training data. Every answer comes with clickable citations pointing to exact passages. You can verify instantly. No hallucination mystery.

Claude Code handles execution - you describe what you want built, and it writes code, creates files, runs tests, and iterates. The problem is that when you're deep in implementation details, your architectural overview gets buried under tokens. This context rot makes comprehensive plans compete with implementation specifics for the same context window.

The recommended separation of concerns: NotebookLM for learning and knowledge retrieval, Claude Code for implementation. Upload 100+ tutorials, documentation files, and code examples to a single NotebookLM notebook. Ask synthesis questions that span all sources. Generate podcast-style audio overviews to listen during your commute while AI hosts debate interpretations and connect ideas. Then return to Claude Code with precise, informed instructions based on actual understanding.

For architects and teams, this pattern suggests a broader principle: separate your learning context from your execution context. The paid NotebookLM plan allows 300 sources per notebook - enough for entire codebases plus architecture documents, code standards, and design decision rationale. Teams can create module-specific notebooks (frontend, backend, infrastructure) and generate onboarding materials automatically. New team members get audio overviews of each major system. Self-paced learning from actual implementation, not outdated docs.

The practical workflows include project discovery (upload requirements docs, generate technical briefs before writing code), debugging assistance (upload problematic files, ask root cause questions, return to Claude with specific understanding), and code review (upload generated code, request technical review, quiz yourself to verify you understand what was built). The gap between "I want this feature" and "I understand this system" closes when you use the right tool for each job.

**Key takeaways:**
- NotebookLM is a RAG system that only answers from your uploaded documents with verifiable citations
- Separation of concerns: use NotebookLM for learning, Claude Code for implementation
- Audio overviews reveal writing weaknesses - if AI hosts struggle to explain something, that section needs revision
- Self-taught programmers can understand AI-generated code by feeding it to NotebookLM for explanation
- Create module-specific notebooks to stay under free tier limits (30 sources) or go comprehensive on paid (300 sources)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Gain verified, citation-backed answers but sacrifice the broad knowledge access of general-purpose AI
- Separate learning and execution contexts to prevent context rot, but add workflow complexity
