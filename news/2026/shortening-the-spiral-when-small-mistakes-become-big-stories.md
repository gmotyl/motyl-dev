## Shortening the Spiral

**TLDR:** A stumbled interview introduction and a forgotten team name became the catalyst for examining how our brains amplify minor mistakes into existential questions about competence. The author draws a powerful parallel between eating disorder recovery techniques and managing workplace self-criticism: the goal is not eliminating the critical thought, but shortening its stay.

**Summary:**

Here is something that does not get talked about nearly enough in professional circles: the sheer amount of mental energy we burn not on actual mistakes, but on the stories we tell ourselves about those mistakes afterward. The author of this piece, writing from within their burnout recovery journey, lays this out with uncomfortable precision. They stumbled over an introduction during an interview panel. They mixed up a team name in a meeting. Two events that, by any objective measure, were completely unremarkable. And yet these moments lodged themselves in their mind like evidence in a prosecution.

What makes this piece genuinely valuable is the honesty about a paradox many high-performers know but rarely admit: recognizing a distortion does not automatically neutralize it. You can sit in a therapy session, clearly articulate that you are blowing something out of proportion, and still feel the gravitational pull of the spiral. Insight is not the same thing as relief, as the author puts it. This is a crucial distinction that most self-help advice glosses over entirely. The "just think positive" crowd has no answer for the gap between knowing something intellectually and feeling it emotionally.

The most compelling idea in this piece is the transferability of recovery skills. The author has been working with a therapist and dietitian on eating disorder recovery, where the explicit goal is not the elimination of disordered thoughts but the reduction of time spent entertaining them. Shortening the spiral. Catching the narrative earlier, before it metastasizes from "I stumbled" into "I am slipping." They are now applying this same framework to workplace self-criticism, and the parallel is striking. It suggests that the mental mechanics underlying burnout, perfectionism, and disordered thinking share more common ground than we typically acknowledge.

There is something the author is dancing around but not quite saying directly: if your identity is welded to competence, then every small deviation is not just a mistake but a threat to who you are. That is an architectural problem, not a behavioral one. The over-preparation, the replaying, the scanning for reassurance in subsequent meetings, these are not just bad habits. They are load-bearing walls in a structure built on performance as identity. Shortening the spiral is essential work, but the deeper question is whether the building itself needs redesigning.

For team leaders and architects of organizational culture, this piece is a quiet alarm bell. The people on your teams who seem most prepared, most reliable, most articulate are often the ones running the most punishing internal narratives. They are not going to tell you about it. They are going to over-prepare for the next meeting and hope you do not notice the exhaustion underneath. Creating environments where small mistakes are genuinely treated as small, not just in policy but in practice, is one of the most impactful things you can do for sustainable performance.

**Key takeaways:**

- Recognizing a cognitive distortion does not automatically stop its emotional pull; awareness and relief are separate processes
- Recovery principles from clinical settings (eating disorder treatment, therapy) can be directly applied to workplace self-criticism and burnout
- The real cost of perfectionism is rarely the mistake itself but the amplification and meaning-making that follows
- Most people in a meeting are focused on their own performance, not building a case against yours
- The goal is not eliminating self-critical thoughts but reducing their residency time, catching the spiral earlier each time

**Tradeoffs:**

- Loosening the grip on perfectionism preserves mental energy but requires accepting that you will sometimes feel less prepared than your internal standard demands
- Shortening the self-critical spiral builds resilience but means sitting with the discomfort of not fully "resolving" every perceived mistake
