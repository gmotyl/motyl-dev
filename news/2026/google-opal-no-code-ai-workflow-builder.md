## How to Build Custom AI Tools in Minutes: Google Opal Workflow Guide

**TLDR:** Google Opal is a free, AI-native workflow builder that lets you create custom automation tools using plain English. Unlike traditional chatbots that give answers, Opal gives you reusable, shareable tools - and it's now natively integrated with Gemini 3.

**Summary:**

If you've been drowning in the endless ocean of AI tools launching every week, Google Opal might be the life raft you didn't know you needed. After five months of beta testing, the author finally articulates why this tool deserves attention: it's not competing with chatbots or traditional automation platforms. It's something fundamentally different.

The core insight is elegantly simple. When you ask ChatGPT or Claude to research something, you get an answer. Then it's over. When you ask Opal to research something, it builds a workflow - a repeatable, editable process you can see, modify, and reuse. You get a web app with input fields and output displays. You can run it tomorrow with different inputs. You can share it with colleagues. Chatbots give answers. Opal gives tools.

What makes Opal particularly interesting is its two-mode design. You can start simple - just describe what you want in plain English. "Build an app to evaluate new AI tools." That's it. Opal figures out the workflow. But when you need control, you can click into the "Build" view and see the visual graph of connected nodes. Input nodes accept text, YouTube URLs, files, images, webcam video, or Google Drive content. Generate nodes access search, web scraping, maps, weather, code execution, and multiple AI models including Gemini 2.5, 3, Veo 3.1, and Deep Research. Output nodes can produce custom HTML, Google Docs, Slides, or Sheets.

The practical example shared is an AI tool evaluation workflow. The author built a system where you input a tool's website URL and five minutes later get a clean HTML report with capability overview, scores against evaluation criteria, and specific workflow recommendations. That's the kind of 10x automation that actually matters - not marginal improvements, but eliminating hours of repetitive research.

For teams and architects considering this, the integration story is compelling. Opal works natively across Google products. Save HTML reports to Drive. Share templates with colleagues. The "Add Asset" feature lets you attach reference materials - your writing style guide, templates, voice examples - so the AI maintains consistency across runs.

The honest comparison with Make and n8n: Opal is simpler and requires less technical knowledge. You don't need to understand JSON parsing or variable mapping to get started. But if you've built automation before, understanding Opal's node patterns - tool calling, Generate node chaining, output formatting - will help you think in systems rather than one-off tasks.

**Key takeaways:**

- Google Opal is completely free and now natively integrated with Gemini 3
- Unlike chatbots that provide answers, Opal builds reusable, shareable workflow tools
- Two-mode design: start with plain English descriptions, graduate to visual node editing when needed
- Supports multimodal inputs (text, video, audio, images) and multiple AI models for generation
- Better user experience than Make or n8n for non-technical users, with less technical overhead

**Tradeoffs:**

- Simplicity for power users - Opal's ease of use may limit fine-grained control compared to Make or n8n
- Google ecosystem dependency gains you seamless integration but sacrifices vendor independence
- No-code approach speeds up creation but sacrifices the flexibility of code-based solutions for edge cases
