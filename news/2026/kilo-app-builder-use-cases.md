## 7 Real Use Cases for Kilo's App Builder
**TLDR:** Kilo's App Builder isn't just a toy for static mockups. It's an end-to-end agentic platform that generates functional, production-ready code for everything from SaaS dashboards to internal ops tools.

**Summary:** Many 'vibe-coding' tools allow you to describe a design, but the resulting code is often a mess that developers have to rewrite. Kilo's App Builder is different: it builds inside an agentic engineering platform. This means your 'described' app is actually production-ready code that can be pulled into an IDE and further refined by AI agents. This week, Kilo highlights seven key ways teams are using it.

Use cases range from founders validating ideas in an afternoon to PMs building functional specs instead of slide decks. Full-stack engineers are using it to spin up frontends while staying focused on backend architecture, and designers are turning their own concepts into working code without a pixel-perfect handoff struggle. It's also becoming a go-to for building internal tools—like commission calculators or vendor trackers—without pulling engineers off core product work.

The core differentiator is 'what happens after the prototype.' Because App Builder is integrated into the wider Kilo ecosystem (with code review and one-click deploy), the prototype *is* the foundation. There is no 'wall' between the design-driven prototype and the engineer-driven product.

**Key takeaways:**
- App Builder generates clean, production-ready code, not just static mockups.
- The tool allows non-technical team members to build functional specs and internal tools.
- Prototypes integrate directly into the Kilo agentic suite for further development.
