## The Other Side of 1-Pizza Teams

**TLDR:** AI tools genuinely boost individual productivity, but an 8-month HBR field study reveals the hidden cost: higher cognitive fatigue and longer hours. When one engineer with AI does the work of four, they absorb four people's worth of cognitive load, and that is a recipe for burnout if not managed deliberately.

**Summary:**

Here is something that should make every engineering leader sit up straight. We have two studies looking at the exact same phenomenon from opposite ends, and they both turn out to be right. Anthropic reports a 50 percent productivity boost for engineers using AI. A Harvard and Wharton study shows individuals with AI matching traditional team output. Sounds incredible. Then HBR drops an 8-month field study titled "AI Doesn't Reduce Work, It Intensifies It." Workers using AI got more done, yes, but they also experienced higher cognitive fatigue and longer hours. One study measured the output. The other measured what it cost the people producing it. Both are correct simultaneously, and that should concern you.

The promise of AI tools is intuitive and appealing. Let the model handle drafting, summarizing, and debugging while you focus on the harder problems. In practice, though, the cognitive load does not disappear. It shifts. Instead of doing the work, you are now orchestrating the work. You are reviewing more outputs, evaluating more AI suggestions, managing more parallel workstreams, and making judgment calls every few minutes. Anyone who has run multiple AI-assisted sessions in parallel knows this feeling. You get more done, but you are genuinely more exhausted at the end of the day. The nature of the tiredness is different, more like decision fatigue than physical labor, but it is very real.

The math that looks so good on a spreadsheet has a fundamental flaw in it. If one person with AI tools can do what a four-person team used to do, that person is now carrying the cognitive load of a four-person team. But they do not get to be four people. They have one brain, one set of working memory registers, one attention budget for the day. Organizations see fewer headcount doing more. The individual experiences compression of mental effort into a single skull. That is the gap nobody is talking about honestly enough.

The article proposes some practical mitigations that are worth examining. Building in recovery time between AI orchestration sessions. Measuring intensity alongside output, not just tracking what shipped but how draining it felt. Planning for sustainable velocity rather than the theoretical maximum of what an AI-augmented engineer could produce. And perhaps most importantly, letting AI actually reduce work rather than just increase throughput. If AI handles 80 percent of code review comments, do not immediately backfill that recovered time with more tasks. Let people breathe.

What the article is somewhat avoiding, though, is the structural incentive problem. Companies that discover they can get four times the output from one person have every economic incentive to push toward that ceiling. Saying "plan for sustainable velocity" is good advice, but it requires leadership that actively resists the optimization pressure that AI productivity data creates. The article comes from a company building AI tools, and while the self-awareness is refreshing, the harder question remains unanswered: who enforces the restraint when the quarterly numbers are right there, waiting to be juiced?

**Key takeaways:**
- AI productivity gains and AI-induced cognitive fatigue are not contradictory findings; they are two sides of the same coin
- The cognitive load shifts from doing work to orchestrating and reviewing work, which is exhausting in a different but equally real way
- Staffing for theoretical maximum AI-augmented output is a fast path to burnout
- Teams should measure cognitive intensity alongside output metrics, not just track what shipped
- Recovery time between AI orchestration sessions matters more than it did in traditional workflows
- Letting AI reduce total work volume, rather than just increase throughput, is the harder but more sustainable choice
- The structural incentive for companies to push individuals toward their AI-augmented ceiling remains the unaddressed elephant in the room
