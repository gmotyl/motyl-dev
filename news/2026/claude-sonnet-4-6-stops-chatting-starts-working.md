## Claude's Done Chatting -- Sonnet 4.6 Turns Claude Into an Operator

**TLDR:** Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.6 this week, delivering sharper reasoning, cleaner multi-step execution, and a 1M token context window that lets Claude retain context across massive documents. The upgrade moves Claude from chatbot territory into genuine project execution, handling real workflows like email thread analysis, spreadsheet cleanup, presentation building, and multi-step projects.

**Summary:**

There is a moment in every tool's evolution where it crosses the line from "neat trick" to "actual teammate." Claude Sonnet 4.6 appears to be that moment for Anthropic's AI assistant. The upgrade is not just about better answers to individual questions -- it is about holding an entire project in its head and executing across multiple steps without losing the thread.

The headline feature is the 1M token context window, which in practical terms means you can hand Claude a 200-page report, months of email threads, entire file directories, and it will keep everything straight. This is not incremental. Most AI assistants start forgetting what you said five messages ago. Claude now behaves like that rare colleague who actually read the entire email chain before replying.

What makes this release genuinely interesting is the shift from "summarize this" to "do this entire job." The newsletter author tested Claude's new computer use capabilities by asking it to build a Google Slides presentation from live YouTube analytics. Claude read the analytics tab, planned its approach, asked for approval, built the slides, and then -- unprompted -- reordered them so the recommendations slide came first because that is what the audience actually needs to see. That kind of judgment call is what separates a tool from a workflow partner.

The newsletter lays out seven practical use cases that take advantage of Sonnet 4.6's strengths: building persistent project workspaces with custom instructions, processing long email threads into action items, analyzing dense documents, turning raw data into presentations, working with spreadsheets, analyzing feedback at scale, and running multi-step projects. Each use case comes with a specific prompt template, and what they all have in common is that they treat Claude as an executor rather than an oracle.

The timing is notable too -- Claude Code just celebrated its first birthday, and Anthropic held a showcase event in San Francisco. One year ago it was a hackathon project; now it underpins how thousands of developers and founders build. The trajectory from experimental toy to production tool mirrors what Sonnet 4.6 represents for the broader Claude product line.

**Key takeaways:**

- Claude Sonnet 4.6 features a 1M token context window, enabling it to retain context across massive documents, email threads, and multi-file projects without losing information
- The upgrade emphasizes execution over conversation -- Claude can now handle multi-step workflows end to end, checking in at each stage before proceeding
- Persistent project workspaces (Claude Projects) let you define your role, audience, voice, and current priorities once, and every conversation inherits that context automatically
- Computer use capabilities allow Claude to interact directly with browser tabs, spreadsheets, and presentation tools, reading live data and building deliverables in place
- The model demonstrates judgment beyond instruction-following, such as reordering presentation slides based on audience needs without being asked
- Claude Code turned one year old this week, having evolved from a hackathon project into a tool used by thousands of builders
- The bottleneck is shifting from the AI's capability to the clarity of the user's direction -- if you are still treating it like a search bar, you are underutilizing what it can do
