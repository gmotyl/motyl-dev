## AI and the Future of (Non-existent) Work

**TLDR:** Three years after ChatGPT's debut, a Yale Budget Lab study suggests AI's impact on employment has been vastly overstated, with no clear evidence of widespread job displacement or creation, challenging Silicon Valley's narrative of AI as a transformative general purpose technology.

**Summary:**

The article presents a compelling reality check on artificial intelligence's actual impact on employment, three years after the ChatGPT phenomenon began. Despite Silicon Valley's persistent claims that generative AI would fundamentally transform work and displace millions of jobs, the evidence suggests a much more modest reality. The author points to a Yale Budget Lab study that questions whether we've been dramatically overestimating AI's disruptive potential in the job market.

What's particularly striking is the disconnect between the technology industry's internal changes and broader economic impact. While AI has indeed affected specific roles like product managers and junior software engineers within tech companies through various pilot programs, this transformation hasn't rippled out into the general economy as predicted. The promised wave of job displacement simply hasn't materialized, nor has the creation of entirely new categories of valuable work that typically accompanies genuine general purpose technologies.

The article introduces an important concept: for AI to qualify as a true General Purpose Technology, we should expect to see innovation and transformation across multiple economic sectors, not just within the technology bubble. The absence of such widespread change three years into the AI revolution raises fundamental questions about whether we're witnessing genuine technological transformation or sophisticated marketing hype.

Perhaps most concerning for the AI industry is the emergence of what the author calls "AI slop" - the proliferation of low-quality, synthetic content that's beginning to pollute digital spaces. This phenomenon, combined with young people's growing exodus from social media platforms overwhelmed by artificial content, suggests that AI's current applications might be creating negative externalities rather than genuine value. The concept of "dead internet theory" gaining traction indicates growing public skepticism about AI-generated content's worth.

For software architects and engineering teams, this analysis suggests a more measured approach to AI adoption might be warranted. Rather than rushing to integrate AI into every system and process, teams should focus on identifying specific, high-value use cases where AI demonstrably improves outcomes. The gap between AI hype and reality means that organizations investing heavily in AI transformation initiatives should carefully evaluate whether they're solving real problems or simply following technological fashion trends.

**Key takeaways:**
- Yale study challenges the narrative of AI causing widespread job displacement after three years of development
- AI's impact remains largely confined to the technology sector rather than transforming the broader economy
- The proliferation of "AI slop" and declining social media engagement among young people suggests negative externalities from current AI applications

**Tradeoffs:**
- Focusing on specific AI use cases provides measurable value but sacrifices the potential for breakthrough innovations from broader experimentation
- Measured AI adoption reduces risk and waste but may cause organizations to miss genuine competitive advantages
