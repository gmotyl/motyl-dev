## How Do I Use ChatGPT for Quarterly Planning?

**TLDR:** Instead of elaborate planning documents that get ignored by March, this framework uses AI to identify ONE primary outcome, three supporting moves, one thing to stop, and a pre-mortem on likely failure modes—all fitting on a screenshot-able card.

**Summary:**

The traditional quarterly planning ritual produces impressive documents in January that become irrelevant by March. The alternative presented here is deliberately minimal: ask AI a single question—"What's the ONE outcome that would make this quarter a win?"—and let it push back on your answer until you have something concrete and actionable.

The output format is intentionally constrained to fit on a screenshot: primary outcome with a deadline, three supporting moves, one thing to stop doing, and critically, a prediction of why it might fail. The Q4 example given: sign one advisory client by December 15. Supporting moves: publish weekly, reach out to five past contacts, kill the course idea consuming attention. Thing to stop: daily analytics checking that changes nothing and burns 40 minutes.

The most powerful element is the failure prediction. Naming your own likely failure mode in advance—"I'll convince myself 'visibility work' counts as finding clients"—creates a form of cognitive commitment that makes falling into that pattern embarrassing. This is essentially a pre-mortem applied to personal productivity, using AI as a neutral interrogator who doesn't accept vague answers.

For architects and team leads, this framework translates directly to project planning. Instead of elaborate roadmaps, what's the ONE deliverable that would make this quarter successful? What three actions directly support it? What activity should stop because it feels productive but isn't? And what's the most likely reason this won't happen? The constraint forces clarity.

The approach works because AI doesn't care about your ego. It keeps asking what's actually in the way and what you're doing that wastes time. The human tendency is to create complex plans that feel comprehensive but provide cover for inaction. A 200-word card you actually look at beats a 20-page document you don't.

**Key takeaways:**
- Replace elaborate planning documents with a single-card format that fits a screenshot
- Use AI to push back on your answers until you have concrete, actionable outcomes
- The failure prediction ("If this fails, it's probably because...") creates accountability
- One thing to stop is as important as things to do—it identifies hidden time sinks

**Tradeoffs:**
- Extreme focus on one outcome gains clarity but sacrifices comprehensive coverage of secondary goals
- Pre-stating failure modes builds accountability but requires honest self-assessment
