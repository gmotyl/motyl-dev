## How I Create All My Newsletter Visuals Without Any Design Skills

**TLDR:** You don't need to be a designer to create compelling visuals for your newsletter. By using a repeatable workflow with five AI tools, you can create custom images, diagrams, and animations in about 15 minutes.

**Summary:**
In a recent Substack post, Kamil, the author of the "AI Adopters Club" newsletter, reveals his entire process for creating the visuals for his publication. He argues that generic stock imagery kills credibility and that custom visuals are essential for making content memorable and building a recognizable brand. His workflow relies on five AI tools, each with a specific purpose.

First, he uses Claude to generate image concepts by pasting his newsletter content and asking for three visual ideas. Then, he uses Google Gemini, with a custom Gem trained on his brand guidelines, to create the actual images. For diagrams and infographics, he uses Napkin.ai, which automatically generates visual options from any text. To add motion, he uses Grok (Imagine) to animate static images, and finally, he uses EasyGIF to convert the animations to lightweight GIFs. This system allows him to create all the visuals for his newsletter in about 15 minutes, ensuring both speed and consistency.

**Key takeaways:**
-   Custom visuals are crucial for newsletter credibility and brand recognition.
-   A repeatable workflow using AI tools can produce high-quality visuals quickly.
-   The five recommended tools are Claude, Google Gemini, Napkin.ai, Grok (Imagine), and EasyGIF.
-   The quality of the output depends on the specificity of the prompts.
