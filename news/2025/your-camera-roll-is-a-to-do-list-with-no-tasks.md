## Your Camera Roll Is a To-Do List With No Tasks

**TLDR:** A system that uses AI to automatically categorize and route screenshots to appropriate destinations (reminders, notes, files, calendar) instead of letting them rot in your camera roll.

**Summary:** 

The article addresses a common digital problem: we take screenshots with the intention of following up on them, but they end up forgotten in our camera roll with no context or pathway to action. Screenshots are essentially unfinished decisions—tasks, references, files, or events with nowhere to go—but our phones treat them all the same way, creating a digital graveyard instead of a functional system.

The solution presented is an AI-powered shortcut system that automatically processes screenshots and routes them to appropriate destinations based on their content. When a screenshot is taken, ChatGPT analyzes it, generates a title and summary, and places it in the right location: reminders for action items, notes for reference material, files for documents, or calendar events for time-sensitive items.

For action items like order tracking numbers, Slack tasks, or confirmation codes, the system creates titled reminders with context and attaches the original screenshot. Instead of an unidentifiable "IMG_4582.png", you get a reminder titled "Track Amazon Order" with the summary "Laptop arriving Tuesday" and the screenshot attached.

For reference materials like design inspiration, interface examples, or important Slack threads, the system creates searchable Apple Notes that preserve both the image and the reason for saving it. The AI generates descriptive titles and summaries, making the content easily discoverable months later through search.

For professional documents like receipts, invoices, or contracts, the system intelligently renames files using lowercase and underscores for better organization and saves them to appropriate iCloud Drive folders. A screenshot of "IMG_4739.png" becomes "slack_budget_thread_Q1_priorities.png" in your project folder.

For event-related screenshots, the system extracts date, time, location, and other details to create calendar entries with the original image attached. This prevents missing events that were "saved" as screenshots but never properly scheduled.

For architects and teams, this system represents a broader principle of using AI to create intelligent routing systems for digital content, preventing information from becoming lost in unstructured storage systems.

**Key takeaways:**

- Screenshots are unfinished decisions that often become forgotten digital clutter
- AI can automatically categorize and route screenshots to appropriate destinations
- Four main routing destinations: reminders, notes, files, and calendar events
- The system adds context and searchability to previously unstructured images
- Proper file naming and organization prevents future frustration
- Automation can transform passive storage into active task management

**Tradeoffs:**

- Requires setup and configuration of AI-powered shortcuts
- Privacy concerns when AI processes personal screenshots
- System depends on internet connectivity and AI service availability
