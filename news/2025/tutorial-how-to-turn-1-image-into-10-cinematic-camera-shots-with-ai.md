## Tutorial: How To Turn 1 Image into 10 Cinematic Camera Shots with AI

**TLDR:** Google's Nano Banana Pro in Gemini allows you to transform a single reference image into 10 different cinematic camera angles while maintaining subject consistency across all generated images.

**Summary:** 

The tutorial demonstrates how to use Google's Nano Banana Pro, built on Gemini 3 Pro, to create multiple cinematic shots from a single reference image. This advanced image generation model offers several key capabilities: mixing up to 8 reference images in a single generation, maintaining strong character/subject consistency across multiple images, and providing advanced camera angle and lighting controls.

The process involves accessing Nano Banana Pro through gemini.google.com by clicking "Create images" from the tools menu and selecting "Thinking" from the model menu. The tutorial outlines 10 specific camera shots to create: wide/establishing, medium, close-up, extreme close-up, low angle, high angle, Dutch angle, over-the-shoulder, profile, and bird's eye view.

The technique involves uploading your reference image and using a specific prompt that asks Gemini to recreate the image into 10 different camera angles while keeping the subject, clothing, setting, and mood consistent. The prompt requests detailed image generation prompts for each of the 10 shots, including camera angle and framing, subject description, setting and background details, lighting and mood, and consistency requirements.

This approach is particularly valuable for content creators, filmmakers, and visual artists who need to explore multiple cinematic perspectives from a single concept. The technology maintains consistency across all generated images, ensuring that the subject, clothing, and setting remain uniform while changing the camera perspective.

For architects and teams working in visual content creation, this technique can be applied to generate multiple perspectives of architectural concepts, product designs, or visual concepts while maintaining consistency across different viewpoints.

**Key takeaways:**

- Google's Nano Banana Pro enables consistent subject generation across multiple camera angles
- 10 different cinematic shots can be generated from a single reference image
- The model maintains subject, clothing, setting, and mood consistency across all generated images
- Key shot types include wide, medium, close-up, extreme close-up, and various angles for dramatic effect
- The process requires using specific prompts to guide the AI in generating consistent results
- Free users have limited generations, requiring a paid Google account for extensive use

**Tradeoffs:**

- Requires a paid Google account for extensive use due to limited generations for free users
- Quality may vary depending on the complexity of the original reference image
