## My Home Office Setup in 2025 🪑

**TLDR:** An updated look at a home office setup for 2025, with a focus on gear for video creation, a deep dive into lighting for energy and mood, and a few high-quality miscellaneous items that make a difference.

**Summary:**
Luca, from the Refactoring newsletter, shares his updated home office setup for 2025. The new setup is driven by an increased focus on video work for his podcast and YouTube channel, a newfound obsession with the impact of lighting on energy and mood, and the need to accommodate a growing team.

The core of the setup is a new solid oak standing desk from Oakywood, paired with an Ergodriven anti-fatigue mat. The tech setup includes a Macbook Pro 16', a CalDigit TS3 Plus dock, and a new Kuycon G32P monitor, which is a more affordable alternative to the Apple Pro Display. For video, he's switched to a Sony ZV-E10 camera and an Elgato Teleprompter, all mounted on a Manfrotto Autopole. The lighting has been completely revamped with Philips Hue smart bulbs and a powerful Amaran 150c light to create a bright and energizing environment. Finally, he shares a couple of miscellaneous items he's been enjoying: a high-quality artificial Ficus from Maia and a modular cup from Hasami porcelain.

**Key takeaways:**
-   A good standing desk and anti-fatigue mat are essential for a comfortable home office.
-   High-quality video and audio gear is a must for content creators.
-   Lighting can have a significant impact on energy and mood.
-   Investing in a few high-quality, well-designed miscellaneous items can improve your daily experience.
