## ☕🤖 Tutorial: 30 Cool Things You Can Make With Google’s Image Model

**TLDR:** Google's new image model, Nano Banana Pro, represents a significant leap forward in image generation technology. This tutorial provides 30 practical, copy-paste-ready prompts that demonstrate its advanced capabilities, including superior text accuracy, style consistency, multi-image merging, and realistic VFX, setting a new standard for creative and technical image manipulation.

**Summary:** The latest image model from Google, dubbed Nano Banana Pro, is making waves in the AI community with its remarkable performance. Initial testing reveals substantial improvements across several key areas of image generation. The model exhibits a level of text accuracy that far surpasses its predecessors, a notoriously difficult challenge for image-based AI. Furthermore, its ability to maintain style consistency across multiple images and seamlessly merge different visual elements is a significant step forward. The quality of its output extends to complex tasks like generating Hollywood-level VFX shots, performing convincing de-aging and relighting of subjects, and creating surprisingly accurate technical diagrams.

This guide offers a hands-on exploration of Nano Banana Pro's potential through 30 distinct use cases, each complete with a ready-to-use prompt. These examples serve as a practical toolkit for both novice and experienced users to experiment with the model's advanced features. The prompts cover a wide range of applications, from transforming stylized portraits into photorealistic images to generating exploded views of objects with precise technical labels. The ability to solve problems and present the solution on a virtual whiteboard, or to transform an entire image into a high-contrast ink drawing, showcases the model's versatility. Other impressive feats include realistically adding elements like falling snow to a scene, complete with accurate shadows and reflections, and seamlessly replacing logos on clothing while matching the fabric's texture and lighting.

For architects and engineering teams, the model's proficiency in creating technical diagrams and exploded views presents a compelling use case. It can accelerate the process of creating detailed visual aids, potentially streamlining communication and documentation. The capacity to generate accurate visual charts, such as one illustrating the ripeness of a banana, also points to its utility in data visualization and educational content. The overall sentiment is that Nano Banana Pro is not just an incremental update but a transformative tool that significantly expands the creative and technical possibilities of AI-driven image generation.
