## Holiday Gift Ideas for Techies 2025

**TLDR:** Gergely Orosz and Elin Nilsson compiled a crowd-sourced gift guide for tech professionals covering office accessories, gadgets, gaming, books, and more. Top recommendations include the Flipper Zero for security enthusiasts, quality noise-cancelling headphones for focus, and experience gifts that pull us away from screens.

Techies are notoriously difficult to shop for—we often already own the practical things we need. This comprehensive guide draws from personal recommendations and crowd-sourced suggestions from X, Bluesky, and Threads to help solve that problem.

For the office, the Ember Temperature Control Mug keeps drinks warm for up to 1.5 hours with a built-in battery—perfect for those coding sessions where coffee goes cold. CO2 monitors have become a personal favorite: when concentration exceeds 1,000 ppm, focus suffers and drowsiness increases. The programmable Ulanzi TC001 mini-desk terminal is consistently popular with developers—it defaults as a clock but can run custom firmware like AWTRIX3 for pomodoro timers or custom displays.

Computer accessories remain reliable choices. The Logitech MX Master 3 mouse gets strong recommendations for all-day comfort and customization. Quality noise-cancelling headphones (Bose QuietComfort Ultra, Sony WH-1000XM5, Apple AirPods Max) provide massive quality-of-work improvement in open offices. For video calls, the Shure MV7 microphone upgrades audio quality significantly over laptop mics.

The Flipper Zero continues as the number one crowd-sourced recommendation for the second year. This multi-tool for security enthusiasts handles infrared remotes, Bluetooth, RF testing, NFC/RFID, and firmware development. For e-ink enthusiasts, the Boox Palma 2 runs Android with Google Play on a phone-sized e-ink display—great for mindful screen time. The Daylight DC-1 takes a different approach with a reflective "Live Paper" LCD designed for deep focus and better sleep health.

The book recommendations include several strong titles: "Tidy First" by Kent Beck for short, impactful guidance on code tidying; "Frictionless" by Nicole Forsgren and Abi Noda addressing why shipping software takes forever despite AI generating code in minutes; "AI Engineering" by Chip Huyen as the definitive text on the field; and "The Scaling Era" by Dwarkesh Patel for understanding LLM evolution.

For architects and engineering leaders considering team gifts or office improvements, several items stand out. CO2 monitors for meeting rooms could improve collective focus. The Analog offline TO-DO system offers a refreshing break from digital tools—write 10 tasks on a "Today" card, mark progress, move unfinished items. Stone paper notebooks (waterproof, tea-proof) make practical gifts that don't add to screen time. Experience gifts like escape rooms, whisky tastings, or even bobsledding create memorable team moments.

What's refreshingly honest about this guide is the acknowledgment that the perfect gift doesn't have to be a gadget. The closing sentiment—that the best gift might be spending time with those we care about—is worth remembering amid the Black Friday marketing blitz. Many recommendations specifically pull people away from screens: books, kitchen tools like the Scizza pizza scissors, the Aarke soda maker, or the Chef's Press for roasted food.

**Key takeaways:**
- Flipper Zero remains the top crowd-sourced recommendation for security-minded techies
- CO2 monitors improve focus by alerting when ventilation is needed (above 1,000 ppm)
- Quality headphones (Bose, Sony, Apple) and the Shure MV7 microphone significantly improve remote work experience
- E-ink devices like Boox Palma 2 and Daylight DC-1 offer screen-time-conscious alternatives
- Experience gifts (escape rooms, tastings, outdoor activities) often create more lasting impact than gadgets
