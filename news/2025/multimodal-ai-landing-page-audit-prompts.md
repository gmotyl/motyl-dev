## Using Multimodal AI for Landing Page Audits

**TLDR:** Multimodal LLMs can now analyze screenshots of your landing pages and provide design critique that rivals expensive CRO consultants. The article presents 5 prompts for getting AI to "roast" your landing page design, helping identify issues like poor button contrast, confusing layouts, and missed conversion opportunities.

The landscape of Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is shifting dramatically. What used to require expensive consultants charging hundreds of dollars per hour can now be accomplished by simply taking a screenshot and feeding it to Claude or ChatGPT. These multimodal AI models have developed sophisticated visual understanding capabilities that allow them to analyze design choices, identify usability problems, and suggest improvements with remarkable accuracy.

The article opens with a compelling real-world example: a moss e-commerce store owner who believed her landing page was "minimalist and chic." After running the page through Claude with a prompt to "roast the design," the AI delivered a brutal but useful assessment—comparing the site to "a 404 Error page for a druid cult" and identifying that the "Add to Cart" button was invisible against the forest-green background. The fix was simple: change the button color. The result: a 15% increase in sales over a single weekend.

This represents a fundamental democratization of design expertise. Previously, getting this kind of feedback required either hiring expensive consultants, conducting time-consuming A/B tests, or gathering user testing data. Now, any developer or business owner can get instant, actionable feedback by uploading a screenshot and asking the right questions.

The broader implication here is significant for teams building products. Rather than waiting for user complaints or declining conversion metrics to identify design problems, you can proactively audit your interfaces before deployment. This shifts the quality assurance process left—catching issues earlier in the development cycle when they're cheaper and easier to fix.

For architects and team leads, this opens up interesting possibilities for establishing design review workflows. Imagine a CI/CD pipeline that automatically captures screenshots of key pages and runs them through an AI audit, flagging potential issues before they reach production. The prompts could be tuned to your brand guidelines, accessibility requirements, and conversion goals.

**Key takeaways:**
- Multimodal LLMs can analyze landing page screenshots and provide instant design critique
- Simple fixes identified by AI (like button color contrast) can lead to significant conversion improvements
- This approach democratizes access to design expertise previously requiring expensive consultants
- Teams can integrate AI-powered visual audits into their development workflow for proactive quality assurance

**Tradeoffs:**
- Gain instant, low-cost design feedback but sacrifice the nuanced understanding that comes from actual user research and testing
- Automated critique provides quick wins but may miss brand-specific or context-dependent design decisions that require human judgment
