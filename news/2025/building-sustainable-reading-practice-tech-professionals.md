## What I am reading in 2025 (and how) 📚

**TLDR:** Luca Cipriani, creator of Refactoring newsletter, completely revamped his reading workflow to combat social media distraction and maintain disciplined reading habits. He built a system around Mailbrew digests, Readwise highlights, and public accountability that helped him reclaim 45 minutes per day from X (Twitter).

**Summary:**

Reading quality deterioration is a silent productivity killer for knowledge workers. Cipriani identified a classic pattern: when work pressure increases, disciplined reading habits collapse first, replaced by mindless social media scrolling. His diagnostic was simple but brutal—checking his Notion highlights revealed "rolling tumbleweeds" during stressful periods. The correlation was clear: less reading time meant more X time, with 90% trash content and only 10% genuinely useful signal.

The architect's approach here is refreshingly top-down. Rather than jumping into tools, he defined clear outcomes: stay current with tech developments, store ideas effectively for writing, and delete X from his iPhone. He recognized that solving the information diet problem would naturally solve the social media addiction problem. This is classic systems thinking—attack the root cause, not the symptoms.

Cipriani's content categorization framework is deceptively simple but profoundly practical. He distilled everything into three buckets: News (breadth over depth, tracking releases and industry movements), Tools (maintaining fresh perspective on quality software), and Stories (individual essays and experiences). This is not arbitrary—it maps directly to the needs of a professional writer who must balance current awareness, technical taste, and human insight. Most engineers would benefit from this same balance, though the proportions might differ.

The publication type taxonomy reveals sophisticated thinking about information sources. Listings (Hacker News, Lobsters, Techmeme) provide high-signal aggregation across all categories. Magazines (The Verge, Ars Technica) focus primarily on news with consistent editorial voice—pick one and commit. Individual blogs offer sporadic but high-quality opinion. The key insight: these categories have different update frequencies and signal qualities, requiring different consumption strategies.

Cipriani's most controversial claim challenges conventional wisdom: you don't need social media to stay informed. The valuable content eventually surfaces through listings like Hacker News anyway. Combined with social media's terrible signal-to-noise ratio and addictive design, it becomes a net negative. This is intellectually honest—he's not claiming social media has zero value, just that the "you must be on social media to stay current" narrative is largely self-serving bullshit that justifies our addictions.

The execution workflow is elegantly simple. Mailbrew consolidates all feeds into a single daily digest. He scans quickly, reads or saves interesting pieces, and captures highlights via Readwise that sync to Notion. The system's genius lies in its recognition that reading must serve a purpose beyond consumption. Your brain is a terrible storage device—you need external knowledge repositories that compound over time.

But the real breakthrough is his accountability architecture. By making his reading list public and subscribable on Mailbrew, and creating a weekly digest newsletter recommending best articles, he manufactured external pressure to maintain quality. This is psychological engineering at its finest—he turned a private, fragile habit into a public commitment with social proof. The feedback was "astounding," creating a powerful flywheel effect. Now he feels responsible to others for keeping sources relevant and identifying great content.

For teams and architects, this offers a blueprint for organizational knowledge management. The Slack channel idea—where engineers share interesting readings regularly—creates distributed learning with minimal overhead. The quarterly blog post goal transforms passive consumption into active synthesis. The key is recognizing that reading without accountability tends toward entropy. You need forcing functions, whether social pressure, publication commitments, or tracking metrics.

The book club example is telling. Despite struggling with non-fiction books, the accountability mechanism enabled Cipriani to read one book every two months—his personal record. This pattern repeats throughout: humans are social creatures who perform better with external structure and peer pressure, even in supposedly solitary activities like reading.

**Key takeaways:**
- Define reading goals explicitly around what matters to your work (news, tools, stories) rather than trying to consume everything indiscriminately
- Categorize sources by both topic and publication type (listings, magazines, blogs) to build a balanced information portfolio with manageable volume
- Social media is optional for staying informed—valuable content eventually surfaces through high-quality aggregators without the addictive downsides
- Build external knowledge repositories (Readwise + Notion) because your brain is terrible at storing retrievable information over time
- Create accountability mechanisms through public sharing, team channels, or writing commitments to transform fragile private habits into sustainable practices

**Tradeoffs:**
- Mailbrew centralization increases convenience but creates single point of failure if service changes or shuts down
- Public accountability provides motivation but adds pressure that may feel burdensome during genuinely busy periods
- Automated digests enable faster scanning but risk creating passive consumption habits instead of active seeking behavior
