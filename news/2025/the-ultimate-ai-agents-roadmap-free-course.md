## The AI Agents Roadmap Nobody Is Teaching You

**TLDR:** A free, 9-lesson course is available that teaches the foundational concepts of building AI agents. It focuses on core principles rather than specific frameworks, covering topics like context engineering, structured outputs, planning, and memory.

**Summary:**
This article introduces a free, in-depth course on the fundamentals of building AI agents. The course is designed to provide a strong intuition for architecting robust AI solutions, moving beyond the hype and focusing on core concepts. The 9 lessons cover a wide range of topics, including the distinction between workflows and agents, context engineering, structured outputs, tool calling, planning (ReAct & Plan-and-Execute), and memory. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to building examples from scratch to provide a deeper understanding of how these systems work under the hood. The author emphasizes that this approach will empower developers to pick up any AI framework and build effective solutions because they will understand the "why" behind the "how." The course also touches on the importance of multimodal agents, which can process information beyond just text.

For architects and development teams, this course offers a valuable opportunity to upskill in the rapidly evolving field of AI agent development. By focusing on first principles, it provides a solid foundation that will remain relevant even as specific tools and frameworks change. The lessons on context engineering and structured outputs are particularly crucial for building reliable and performant AI systems. The course's emphasis on understanding trade-offs, such as control vs. autonomy, will help teams make more informed design decisions when building their own AI applications.

**Key takeaways:**
- A free 9-lesson course on AI agent fundamentals is available.
- The course focuses on core concepts, not specific frameworks.
- Key topics include context engineering, structured outputs, planning, and memory.
- The goal is to build a strong intuition for architecting robust AI solutions.
