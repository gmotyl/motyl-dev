## Will AI eat the world in 2026?

**TLDR:** This article challenges the techno-optimist narrative that AI is "eating the world." Instead, it suggests we are in a massive, supply-side bubble driven by the AI infrastructure build-out, with hyperscalers like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft at its center. The author questions the true useful life of AI hardware and points to a potential future convergence of tech debt, national debt, and political instability.

**Summary:**
Pivoting from Marc Andreessen's famous "Software is Eating the World" essay, this piece from AI-Supremacy casts a skeptical eye on the current state of artificial intelligence. The central argument is that despite the hype, AI is not yet "eating the world." Instead, the real story might be the colossal, and potentially unsustainable, infrastructure boom. The author posits that companies like Nvidia, Google, and TSMC are the true giants, feasting on the insatiable demand for datacenters and GPUs. The narrative of impending superintelligence is framed as a distraction from a more mundane but critical economic reality: we might be witnessing a classic supply-side bubble.

The article highlights the work of Michael Burry, who has raised serious questions about the accounting practices of hyperscalers. Burry's thesis suggests that the useful life of state-of-the-art AI GPUs is much shorter—perhaps only 2-3 years—than the longer depreciation schedules these companies are using. This accounting discrepancy could be masking the true, astronomical costs of the AI arms race, inflating valuations and creating a glut of infrastructure that may not have a clear, profitable use case in the short term. The author argues that we are late in the trade, not early, and that historical patterns of tech bubbles suggest a correction is inevitable.

For architects and technology leaders, this article serves as a crucial counter-narrative to the prevailing hype. It urges a more critical evaluation of the long-term return on investment for massive AI infrastructure projects. The key question isn't just "can we build it?" but "what is the sustainable, profitable application?" The analysis suggests that the real risk isn't a rogue superintelligence but a massive, capital-fueled bubble bursting. The convergence of this tech bubble with a looming national debt crisis and political instability presents a sobering picture for the coming years.

The author doesn't provide a definitive answer but leaves the reader with a set of critical questions. It challenges the assumption that more infrastructure and more powerful models will automatically lead to proportional value creation. The missing piece in the optimistic narrative is a clear line of sight to widespread, profitable applications that can justify the trillions being invested. The article implies that we are building the digital equivalent of empty cities, fueled by questionable accounting and a fear of missing out, and the reckoning may be closer than we think.

**Key takeaways:**
- The current AI boom may be better described as an infrastructure and datacenter bubble, not AI "eating the world."
- Hyperscaler accounting practices for GPU depreciation might be masking the true cost and creating a supply-side glut.
- The useful life of cutting-edge AI hardware may be only 2-3 years, far shorter than what is being reported.
- We may be late in the AI investment cycle, not early, and a market correction based on historical bubble patterns is possible.
- The convergence of a potential AI bubble with broader economic and political crises poses a significant future risk.
