## Being a founding engineer at an AI startup

**TLDR:** Michelle Lim, who was the first engineer at Warp and is now building her own AI startup, Flint, shares her playbook for success as a founding engineer. She emphasizes that standing out requires having hands-on AI project experience and a willingness to take on crucial non-engineering tasks like marketing and community management. Above all, she stresses the importance of picking the right founders and having a strong, product-first mindset.

**Summary:**
In a conversation with The Pragmatic Engineer, Michelle Lim offers a masterclass on the role of a founding engineer, particularly in the white-hot AI startup scene. Drawing from her experiences at Facebook, Slack, Robinhood, and as the first engineering hire at the developer-centric startup Warp, she provides a candid look at what it takes to succeed in such a high-stakes environment. Her core message is that technical skill, while essential, is only part of the equation. To truly excel, a founding engineer must adopt a "product-first" mindset and be willing to do whatever it takes to move the business forward.

Lim's advice for aspiring founding engineers in AI is direct: build something. In a field where practical experience is still relatively scarce, simply having a side project that uses a modern AI model or API immediately sets a candidate apart. It demonstrates initiative and a genuine interest in the space. Once in the role, she argues that the key is to volunteer for the unglamorous but critical tasks that no one else wants to do. For her, this meant writing blog posts, managing Hacker News threads, starting the company's Twitter and YouTube channels, and building a Discord community—all while excelling at her primary role as a software engineer. This willingness to step outside the traditional bounds of an engineering role is what creates immense value and provides a steep learning curve in understanding what a business truly needs.

The discussion also delves into the practicalities of joining an early-stage venture. Lim offers sharp advice on evaluating opportunities, including the non-obvious but crucial step of asking to speak with the founders' own references. This allows a candidate to get a more complete picture of the leaders they would be working with. She also touches on equity negotiation, tech stack choices (favoring pragmatism over hype), and how to identify different types of founding engineers. The conversation is a must-listen for anyone considering a move to an early-stage startup, as it demystifies the role and provides a clear, actionable framework for success.

For engineering leaders, Lim's perspective is a powerful reminder of the qualities that define a "10x" engineer in a startup context. It's not just about coding speed; it's about ownership, product sense, and a relentless focus on the business's success. The interview challenges the siloed nature of many engineering teams and makes a strong case for a more integrated, product-driven approach. However, one point the discussion doesn't fully explore is the potential for burnout when a single individual takes on so many disparate roles. While Lim's drive is admirable, scaling this model requires a careful balance and a clear understanding of when to hire specialists. It's a model for the first few hires, but not necessarily a sustainable structure for a growing team.

**Key takeaways:**
- **Build to Stand Out:** For AI startups, having personal projects using AI models is a key differentiator for aspiring founding engineers.
- **Go Beyond the Code:** A great founding engineer takes on critical non-engineering tasks like marketing, community building, and writing to drive the business forward.
- **Product-First Mindset:** The focus should always be on the product and the user, not just the technology.
- **Vet the Founders:** Don't just let founders reference-check you; ask for their references to understand their leadership style and track record.
- **Embrace the Hustle:** The founding engineer role is about doing whatever is necessary for the success of the startup, which provides an unparalleled learning experience.
