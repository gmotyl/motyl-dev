## How to Use Claude Skills to Automate Your Workflow

**TLDR:** Claude Skills are modular instruction packages that extend Claude's capabilities for specialized tasks like brand guidelines enforcement. Skills export as ZIP files containing markdown instructions and resources, with cross-platform compatibility for ChatGPT and Gemini.

Anthropic's Skills feature transforms Claude from a general-purpose assistant into a specialized one for specific tasks. Rather than repeatedly explaining brand guidelines, chart styles, or workflow requirements in every conversation, Skills package these instructions as reusable modules that Claude applies automatically.

The practical difference is significant. A presentation request without skills produces generic output. The same request with Anthropic's brand guidelines skill enabled generates presentations that actually look like Anthropic created them - consistent colors, typography, and visual design principles applied throughout. This moves beyond prompt engineering into persistent, modular customization.

Creating skills requires minimal effort. A simple prompt like "Help me create a skill that applies Google's official brand colors and typography" generates a downloadable ZIP file. The package contains SKILL.md - a markdown document with task-handling instructions - plus optional resources like examples, templates, and executable code. Claude asks clarifying questions for simple prompts, helping refine the skill before generation.

The cross-platform compatibility is unexpectedly useful. ZIP files generated by Claude work with ChatGPT and Gemini. You can create a brand guidelines skill in Claude and deploy it across your team's varied AI tool preferences. The author notes ChatGPT sometimes interprets the guidelines better than Claude itself, suggesting these skill packages function as reasonably portable AI instruction sets.

The skill-creator skill should remain enabled when building new skills - the author reports upload errors when creating skills without it. This meta-skill helps Claude generate properly structured packages. Beyond brand guidelines, example skills include CSV data summarizers with visualizations and meeting intelligence tools that gather context from Notion and generate pre-reads.

For teams standardizing AI-assisted workflows, Skills represent a step toward reproducible AI behavior. The ability to export, share, and import skill packages creates organizational knowledge that persists beyond individual conversations. The main limitations are subscription requirements (Pro, Max, or Team), occasional inconsistent results, and unintended skill activation when instructions match prompts broadly.

**Key takeaways:**
- Skills package reusable instructions in ZIP files containing markdown and resources
- Cross-platform compatibility enables using Claude-generated skills in ChatGPT and Gemini
- Keep skill-creator skill enabled when building new skills to avoid upload errors
- Simple prompts work well - Claude asks clarifying questions to refine the skill

**Tradeoffs:**
- Pre-built skills save time but may activate unintentionally on matching prompts
- Detailed skill instructions improve consistency but require upfront investment to create
