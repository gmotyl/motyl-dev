## Frictionless: why great developer experience can help teams win in the ‘AI age’

**TLDR:** Nicole Forsgren and Abi Noda's new book, "Frictionless," provides a practical guide for improving developer experience (DevEx) to drive business outcomes. The book argues that reducing friction in developer workflows is key to unlocking the full potential of engineering teams, especially in the age of AI.

**Summary:**
This article from Gergely Orosz's "The Pragmatic Engineer" newsletter features an interview with Nicole Forsgren and Abi Noda, the authors of the new book "Frictionless." The book is a follow-up to the highly influential "Accelerate" and the DORA and SPACE frameworks. While "Accelerate" focused on the "why" of high-performing technology organizations, "Frictionless" focuses on the "how." It provides a step-by-step process for improving developer experience, based on the authors' years of hands-on work with engineering teams.

The authors argue that even with the rise of AI-powered coding tools, shipping software is still often a slow and frustrating process. The reason, they say, is "friction" – the invisible barriers in developer workflows that turn quick wins into endless delays. The book provides a seven-step process for identifying and reducing this friction, along with frameworks for making the business case for DevEx investments. The authors emphasize that improving DevEx is not just about making developers happier; it's about driving tangible business outcomes like increased revenue, lower costs, and faster time-to-market.

For technology leaders and architects, the key takeaway is that investing in developer experience is a strategic imperative. The article highlights several case studies, including from Etsy and Capital One, that demonstrate the significant ROI of DevEx initiatives. The book also provides a framework for measuring the impact of DevEx improvements, connecting them to financial outcomes that resonate with C-level executives. As AI continues to reshape the software development landscape, the ability to create a frictionless developer experience will be a key differentiator for high-performing teams.

**Key takeaways:**
- "Frictionless" is a practical guide to improving developer experience (DevEx).
- Reducing friction in developer workflows is key to unlocking engineering productivity.
- DevEx investments can be directly tied to business outcomes like revenue growth and cost savings.
- Measuring and communicating the value of DevEx is crucial for securing organizational support.
