## Know Exactly Who to Promote, Develop, or Let Go

**TLDR:** The 9-Box Grid is a powerful HR tool for mapping employee performance against potential. By using an AI-guided session to implement this framework, managers can move beyond guesswork and make data-driven decisions about talent management.

**Summary:**
Many managers struggle with performance reviews and succession planning, often relying on gut feelings and recent events. This can lead to promoting the wrong people, overlooking high-potential employees, and retaining underperformers for too long. The 9-Box Grid offers a systematic solution by categorizing employees into nine distinct segments based on their current performance and future potential. This article provides a practical guide to implementing the 9-Box Grid, not as a static template, but as a dynamic planning tool. It suggests using an AI assistant like ChatGPT or Claude to facilitate the process. The AI can ask pointed questions about each employee, forcing managers to think critically and provide evidence for their assessments. This structured approach helps to identify future leaders, solid contributors, and individuals who may need more support or a different role. For architects and team leads, this is a valuable framework for building high-performing teams and ensuring that the right people are in the right roles to drive the company's technical vision forward.

**Key takeaways:**
- The 9-Box Grid is a structured framework for assessing employee performance and potential.
- Using an AI-guided session can help managers implement the grid more effectively and avoid common biases.
- The framework provides clear actions for each employee category, from high-potentials to underperformers.
- This systematic approach to talent management can lead to better promotions, higher retention of top talent, and a stronger overall team.
