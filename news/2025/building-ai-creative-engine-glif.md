## I Built My Own AI Creative Engine (Here's How You Can Too)

**TLDR:** The next level of AI-powered creativity lies not in using individual tools, but in orchestrating them into powerful, multimodal workflows. Platforms like Glif.app are making this possible by allowing users to connect text, image, video, and audio models into composable, reusable “creative engines” without writing code.

**Summary:** The author makes a compelling case that we are witnessing an evolution in how we interact with AI, moving from simple chatbot conversations to building complex, automated creative systems. The core problem with the current landscape is that while individual AI tools for text, images, and video are powerful, they exist in silos. The process of manually stitching their outputs together is inefficient and cumbersome. The solution lies in platforms purpose-built for AI orchestration, like Glif.app. Unlike general automation tools such as Zapier or Make, which are designed for business apps, Glif is designed from the ground up to seamlessly connect multimodal AI models. This allows a user to, for example, take a paragraph of text, automatically generate a concept for an infographic, create the visual using a specific image model, and then add narration, all within a single, repeatable workflow. For architects and developers, this represents a paradigm shift from thinking in tasks to thinking in systems. The author argues that building these “creative engines” provides an “unfair advantage,” not just by being faster, but by being more capable. The author does not discuss the potential vendor lock-in or the limitations of the platform's available models.

**Key takeaways:**
-   The future of creative AI is in orchestrating multiple models, not just using them in isolation.
-   Platforms like Glif.app are purpose-built for creating multimodal AI workflows (text, image, video, audio).
-   This approach allows you to build reusable “creative engines” that solve specific, recurring problems.
-   The key is to think in terms of systems and workflows, not just individual tasks or prompts.
-   The distinction between on-demand creative augmentation and fully automated background tasks is crucial; these tools are for augmenting your judgment, not replacing it.
