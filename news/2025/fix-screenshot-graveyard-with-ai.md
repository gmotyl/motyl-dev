## Your Screenshots Are a Graveyard. Here's the Fix.

**TLDR:** Your phone's camera roll is where screenshots go to die, buried under meaningless filenames. This article provides a step-by-step guide to building an automated system using Apple Shortcuts and AI (like ChatGPT) to intelligently name your screenshots based on their content, making them instantly searchable.

**Summary:** The core problem, as the author Tiffany explains, is that our devices are built for storage, not retrieval. We take screenshots with a specific purpose, but they immediately become digital clutter because their filenames are useless. `IMG_4739.png` tells you nothing, but `slack_thread_Q4_budget.png` is a file you can actually find later. The solution is to create a system that thinks "searchable" instead of just "organized."

The article details several levels of automation you can build using the Shortcuts app on your iPhone and Mac. The system uses AI to analyze the visual content of a screenshot and generate a descriptive filename. For example, a manual shortcut can batch-process your existing screenshots, renaming them and saving them to iCloud Drive. A more advanced version can categorize them into folders like "Business" or "Travel". For Mac users, a folder automation can rename screenshots the instant they are taken.

Beyond screenshots, the author also proposes a similar system for your videos. A shortcut can transcribe the audio from your videos and save the text to your Notes app. This effectively creates a searchable database of all your spoken content from videos, making it easy to find specific topics you've discussed. The setup for these automations is surprisingly quick, and the article provides the guidance to get started. It's a practical application of on-device AI to solve a common digital organization problem.

**Key takeaways:**
- Stop letting your screenshots become a disorganized mess with unsearchable filenames.
- Use Apple Shortcuts and AI to automatically name screenshots based on their visual content.
- Several automation levels are possible: manual batching, categorized sorting, and real-time renaming on a Mac.
- The same principle can be applied to videos by transcribing their audio to create a searchable text archive.
- The goal is to make your digital content findable, not just stored.
