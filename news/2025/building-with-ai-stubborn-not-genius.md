## You Don't Need to Be a Genius to Build with AI. You Just Need to Be Stubborn.

**TLDR:** Building useful AI tools doesn't require a deep understanding of the underlying technology. What matters more is a clear process, the ability to write clear instructions, and the patience to iterate until you get the results you want.

**Summary:**
This article from "Smart Prompts for AI" on Substack argues that the barrier to entry for building with AI has been dramatically lowered. The author compares wrangling a Large Language Model (LLM) to training a dog – it's less about being a genius and more about having a consistent process and clear commands. The author dismisses the hype around needing to be a "Prompt Engineer" with a specialized degree to build useful AI applications. Instead, they argue that the key skills are now writing clearly and being persistent enough to tinker and iterate.

The author reflects on the "Dark Ages" of Natural Language Processing, when a deep understanding of math and computer science was a prerequisite. Today, the landscape has shifted. The people who are succeeding are not necessarily the ones with the most technical knowledge, but the ones who are most stubborn and have a clear process. The article promises to walk readers through how to build practical AI tools without writing any code, focusing on workflows and structured prompting.

For anyone feeling intimidated by the AI hype, this article is a breath of fresh air. It demystifies the process of building with AI and empowers a broader audience of creators and entrepreneurs. The core message is that the "magic" of AI is becoming a commodity, and the real value is in how you apply it to solve real-world problems. This is a crucial mindset shift for anyone looking to leverage AI in their work. It’s not about being a genius; it’s about being a tinkerer and a problem-solver.

**Key takeaways:**
- The barrier to entry for building with AI is shifting from technical expertise to having a clear process and the ability to iterate.
- You don't need to be a programmer or a data scientist to build useful AI tools.
- The key skills for building with AI are clear communication and stubbornness.
- The current phase of AI is less about magic tricks and more about practical applications.
