## What I Learned Sharing the Stage with AI Experts at Limitless Live 2025

**TLDR:** Most people use AI like a "little can robot" asking for answers—but the real value comes from treating it like Yoda and asking for questions instead. The shift from "give me the answer" to "help me think" fundamentally changes how useful these tools become.

**Summary:**

The core reframe here is elegant: stop asking AI for answers and start asking it for questions. Most users approach AI backwards—they want output when they should want input on their thinking. When you treat AI as a thought partner rather than an answer machine, you're asking it to help you think through your day, your decisions, your blind spots. That's a fundamentally different relationship with the technology.

The observation that "AI is a probability machine generating words based on distributions" carries an important warning. It can go down low-probability paths and just keep going, hallucinating confidently into absurdity. The Stanford professor facing perjury charges for citing a ChatGPT-generated source that didn't exist is a stark reminder: validation is now your job. You must stay in the driver's seat.

Another framing that resonates: "AI is a great DJ. You decide which vinyls to play." The example of writing 48 children's stories based on the 48 Laws of Power illustrates this perfectly. AI didn't suggest that creative mashup—the human brought the weird idea and the vision. AI handled the cross-domain synthesis and speed. That's the split: you bring direction, AI brings velocity.

For practical workflow design, the "every" trigger is useful. Every time you post on social media, every time you onboard a client, every time you send a weekly report—that word signals repetition, and repetition signals automation opportunity. What previously required no-code tools can now be built in minutes. Small hinges swing big doors.

The ChatGPT Projects feature surfaced as an underutilized capability. Creating separate spaces with custom instructions and documents for different contexts—business, family, specific projects—isn't just organization. It helps your brain context-switch properly. When you're in your business project, you think like a business owner. The tool forces the compartmentalization your brain needs anyway.

For architects and teams, the "Director's Chair" metaphor applies directly. If you were a graphic designer, you're no longer a pixel pusher—you're directing the work, setting the vision while AI handles execution. That promotion comes with new skills: critical thinking, storytelling, knowing when to push back on AI outputs and when to trust them. The warning about mental fitness is worth taking seriously: just as physical labor once kept us fit and now fitness is a choice, the same will happen with thinking. Staying mentally fit will become a deliberate decision.

**Key takeaways:**
- Ask AI for questions, not answers—treat it as Yoda, not a vending machine
- You bring direction and vision; AI brings speed and cross-domain synthesis
- Listen for the word "every" in your workflows—it signals automation opportunity
- Use ChatGPT Projects to create context-specific workspaces that help your brain switch modes
- Validation is your job—AI hallucinates, and the consequences can be severe
- Critical thinking and staying "mentally fit" become deliberate choices in the AI era

**Tradeoffs:**
- Delegating execution to AI increases speed but requires developing new validation and direction skills
- Context-specific AI workspaces improve focus but add setup overhead and fragmentation
