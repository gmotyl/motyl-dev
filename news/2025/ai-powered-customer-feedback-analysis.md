## 4 Prompts to Spot Trends in Customer Reviews

**TLDR:** Stop manually categorizing customer feedback. Use a structured, multi-prompt LLM workflow to turn unstructured rants into actionable engineering tickets. Clean your data first for best results.

**Summary:** The author recounts the pain of manual "Voice of the Customer" analysis, highlighting its inefficiency and bias. LLMs offer a superior, emotionless alternative for processing vast amounts of feedback. However, simply dumping raw data into a model yields generic, useless insights. The key is a refined workflow involving data hygiene (stripping noise like timestamps and user IDs) and a series of specific prompts. The author recommends batching large datasets to avoid the model "forgetting" information in the middle. The article provides the exact prompts used in this workflow.

**Key takeaways:**
- Manual feedback analysis is slow, biased, and should be automated.
- Clean your data before feeding it to an LLM to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
- Don't just use one generic prompt; a multi-prompt chain is more effective.
- Batch large datasets and summarize the summaries for better accuracy.
