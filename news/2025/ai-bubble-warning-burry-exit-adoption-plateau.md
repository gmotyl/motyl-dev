## AI Adoption Rates Starting to Flatten Out

**TLDR:** New data from the Census Bureau and Ramp reveals AI adoption rates are plateauing across all business sizes, suggesting the initial wave of AI enthusiasm may be cooling as organizations reach practical limits.

**Summary:**

The honeymoon phase with AI appears to be ending. Data from both the U.S. Census Bureau and corporate spending platform Ramp shows a clear flattening in AI adoption rates across American businesses of all sizes. This is particularly striking given the massive investment and media attention around AI throughout 2024.

The Ramp AI Index, which tracks adoption among over 40,000 American businesses representing billions in corporate spending, provides a real-time view of how companies are actually deploying AI tools rather than just talking about them. The flattening suggests we're moving from the early adopter phase into what Geoffrey Moore would call the "chasm" – that critical gap between early adopters and the early majority.

What's fascinating is that this plateau is occurring simultaneously across different firm sizes, suggesting this isn't just a resource constraint issue. Large enterprises with deep pockets are hitting the same adoption ceiling as smaller businesses. This points to more fundamental challenges: integration complexity, unclear ROI, or simply that the current generation of AI tools has reached their practical utility limits for most business processes.

For architects and engineering teams, this data suggests a more measured approach to AI integration is warranted. Rather than rushing to implement AI everywhere, focus on identifying specific, high-value use cases where the technology demonstrably improves outcomes. The plateau indicates that the "AI washing" phase is ending, and organizations are becoming more discerning about where AI actually adds value versus where it's just technological novelty.

**Key takeaways:**
- AI adoption rates are flattening across all business sizes according to Census Bureau and Ramp data
- The plateau suggests movement from early adopter enthusiasm to more pragmatic evaluation
- Organizations appear to be hitting practical limits rather than just resource constraints

**Tradeoffs:**
- Measured AI adoption reduces implementation risks but may sacrifice competitive advantages from early deployment

## How are Americans using AI? Evidence from a nationwide survey

**TLDR:** A comprehensive Brookings survey reveals 57% of Americans use AI personally while only 20% use it professionally, with stark educational divides and worker skepticism about job displacement effects.

**Summary:**

This Brookings research, conducted through the University of Chicago's NORC AmeriSpeak panel, provides the most comprehensive picture yet of how Americans actually interact with AI technology. The findings reveal a fascinating disconnect between personal enthusiasm and professional skepticism.

The 57% personal usage rate is remarkably high, suggesting AI tools like ChatGPT, image generators, and voice assistants have achieved genuine mainstream adoption for personal tasks. However, the drop to just 20% professional usage tells a different story. This isn't simply about workplace restrictions – it suggests that either current AI tools aren't well-suited to most people's job requirements, or that organizations are being cautious about integration.

The educational divide is particularly striking and concerning. Higher education correlates strongly with increased AI usage across all categories. This creates a potential feedback loop where those already advantaged by education gain additional productivity benefits from AI, while those without higher education miss out on these tools entirely. It's reminiscent of the digital divide we saw with internet adoption, but potentially more consequential given AI's productivity implications.

The worker pessimism about job displacement is noteworthy. More respondents believe AI will reduce jobs than create them, which may be contributing to slower professional adoption. This suggests a need for better change management and education around AI's role as an augmentation tool rather than a replacement technology.

For engineering teams and architects, this data highlights the importance of designing AI systems with diverse user bases in mind. The educational divide suggests that effective AI tools need to be intuitive enough for users without technical backgrounds, while the professional adoption gap indicates that workplace AI tools need better integration with existing workflows and clearer value propositions.

**Key takeaways:**
- Personal AI usage (57%) significantly outpaces professional usage (20%)
- Educational level is the strongest predictor of AI adoption across all categories
- Workers are more pessimistic than optimistic about AI's impact on employment

**Tradeoffs:**
- Widespread personal adoption builds familiarity but professional caution may slow productivity gains

## OpenAI's Computing Needs Drive $96 Billion in Partner Debt

**TLDR:** Companies supporting OpenAI's infrastructure have accumulated $96 billion in debt while OpenAI itself projects only $20 billion in revenue, highlighting unsustainable economics in the AI infrastructure boom.

**Summary:**

This Financial Times analysis exposes the precarious financial foundation underlying the AI boom. The numbers are staggering: OpenAI has made $1.4 trillion in future commitments for energy and computing power, yet expects only $20 billion in revenue this year. Even more concerning, HSBC's analysis suggests that even if OpenAI reaches $200 billion in revenue by 2030, it would still need an additional $207 billion in funding to remain viable.

The debt breakdown reveals how deeply leveraged the entire AI ecosystem has become. SoftBank, Oracle, and CoreWeave have borrowed $30 billion, Blue Owl Capital and Crusoe another $28 billion, with $38 billion more in negotiations. CoreWeave's situation is particularly telling – the company carries $14 billion in current and non-current debt plus $39 billion in future lease obligations, against just $5 billion in expected revenue.

This represents a fundamental shift in how AI infrastructure is being funded. Previously, tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon funded AI development from their cash reserves. Now we're seeing a debt-fueled expansion model that's reminiscent of previous technology bubbles. The Bank of America data showing hyperscalers taking on $121 billion in new debt this year – four times their historical average – confirms this isn't isolated to OpenAI's partners.

The credit market implications are already visible, with corporate debt issuance running 70% higher than typical for this time of year. This debt-driven expansion model creates systemic risks. If AI revenues don't materialize as projected, we could see a cascade of defaults across the infrastructure providers that underpin the entire AI ecosystem.

For architects and engineering teams, this financial reality check suggests focusing on AI implementations that deliver clear, measurable value rather than speculative future benefits. The debt levels indicate that current AI infrastructure pricing may not be sustainable long-term, potentially leading to either significant price increases or service disruptions as companies struggle to service their obligations.

**Key takeaways:**
- OpenAI's partners have accumulated $96 billion in debt to support AI infrastructure
- The hyperscalers have quadrupled their typical debt issuance to fund AI operations
- Current revenue projections appear insufficient to service the accumulated debt levels

**Tradeoffs:**
- Debt-funded AI expansion enables rapid scaling but creates systemic financial risks across the ecosystem

## Michael Burry Deregisters Scion Asset Management

**TLDR:** The "Big Short" investor has shut down his hedge fund while maintaining sharp criticism of AI infrastructure accounting practices and warning of a technology bubble reminiscent of previous market manias.

**Summary:**

Michael Burry's decision to deregister Scion Asset Management isn't just a business move – it's a statement. Known for his prescient call on the 2008 housing crisis, Burry has been increasingly vocal about what he sees as accounting manipulation in the AI sector, particularly around infrastructure depreciation schedules.

His core thesis is compelling and technically sophisticated. Burry argues that companies like Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and Meta are stretching depreciation schedules on their massive AI infrastructure investments to smooth earnings and make their AI spending appear more profitable than it actually is. His estimate that this could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028 represents a significant accounting distortion.

This isn't just theoretical concern – it's about fundamental business economics. When companies spend billions on Nvidia chips and data centers but depreciate them over extended periods, they're essentially borrowing from future earnings to make current AI investments look viable. This creates a false impression of AI profitability that could be driving continued over-investment in the sector.

Burry's timing is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of flattening adoption rates and mounting debt levels across the AI ecosystem. His decision to step away from traditional fund management while maintaining his "Cassandra Unchained" persona suggests he sees systemic risks that make normal investment strategies untenable.

The reference to operating "off the grid" and potentially moving to a family office structure indicates Burry believes the current market dynamics are too distorted for traditional value investing approaches. This mirrors his behavior before the 2008 crisis, when he also positioned himself outside conventional market structures.

For technology leaders and architects, Burry's warnings about AI accounting practices should prompt deeper scrutiny of vendor financial statements and infrastructure cost projections. If depreciation schedules are indeed being manipulated, it could lead to sudden price adjustments as companies face reality about their true AI infrastructure costs.

**Key takeaways:**
- Burry has shut down his hedge fund while intensifying criticism of AI sector accounting practices
- He estimates $176 billion in understated depreciation across major tech companies through 2028
- The move mirrors his pre-2008 crisis positioning outside conventional market structures
