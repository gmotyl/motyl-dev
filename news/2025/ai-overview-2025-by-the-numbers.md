## An AI Overview 2025 (by the numbers)

**TLDR:** A data-driven analysis of the AI landscape in 2025 suggests that while the enterprise AI market is booming, there are signs of an AI bubble. Anthropic is emerging as a major player in the enterprise space, while OpenAI is facing increasing competition and challenges to its business model.

**Summary:**
This article from "AI Supremacy" on Substack provides a detailed overview of the AI landscape in 2025, drawing on data from various reports and sources. The author argues that while the AI market is experiencing rapid growth, particularly in the enterprise sector, there are also clear signs of a bubble. The article highlights the meteoric rise of Anthropic, which has captured a significant share of the enterprise AI market, surpassing OpenAI in some key areas. The author predicts that Anthropic's growth will continue to accelerate in 2026, while OpenAI's growth may stall due to increasing competition and a business model that is at odds with its mission.

The article also touches on the broader societal impacts of AI, including the different perspectives of corporate leaders and the general public, and the potential mental health risks for young people. It also notes the rapid progress of open-source AI, particularly from Chinese companies, which are gaining traction among developers and startups. The author concludes with a warning about the potential for the AI bubble to burst, citing the opinions of prominent investors and economists.

For anyone following the AI space, this article provides a valuable, data-rich perspective that cuts through some of the hype. The analysis of the competitive dynamics between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google is particularly insightful. The focus on enterprise AI as a key battleground is also important, as this is where the real value of AI is likely to be created in the coming years. The concerns about an AI bubble are also well-founded and serve as a useful reality check for anyone who is overly optimistic about the short-term prospects of the AI market.

**Key takeaways:**
- The enterprise AI market is growing rapidly, with Anthropic emerging as a major player.
- OpenAI is facing increasing competition and challenges to its business model.
- There are growing concerns about an AI bubble, with some experts predicting a significant market correction.
