## Your Team Stopped Questioning AI Six Weeks Ago

**TLDR:** Microsoft research found that after six months of using AI, teams showed measurably declining critical evaluation skills. The culprit? Deploying AI exclusively as a "doer" (executing tasks) rather than a "thinker" (challenging assumptions). Teams that use AI to provoke questions rather than just provide answers make better strategic decisions, even if it's slower and more uncomfortable.

**Summary:**

The article opens with a cautionary tale: a strategy team shipped an AI-drafted market entry plan that looked authoritative and data-backed, only to discover three months later it was based on wrong market assumptions, wrong timing, and wrong competitive analysis. Cost: $2 million. The problem wasn't hallucination—it was that no one forced the AI to defend its reasoning. They approved it because it sounded confident.

Microsoft Research documented this phenomenon systematically. Teams using AI for six months exhibited declining critical evaluation skills. The pattern is insidious: as more tasks get delegated to AI, less questioning happens. Speed increases, but judgment degrades. The author argues this stems from how teams deploy AI—almost exclusively as "doers" (draft emails, summarize docs, automate workflows) rather than "thinkers" (spot gaps, surface overlooked stakeholders, challenge default assumptions).

Professor Leon Prieto's MBA experiment crystallizes the difference. Students tackled an electric vehicle supply chain case involving cobalt sourcing from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Group A used doer AI—got research summaries, risk frameworks, templates—and delivered recommendations in 90 minutes. Group B used thinker AI that asked probing questions, identified stakeholders students had missed (local communities facing displacement, labor monitoring agencies, environmental groups), and flagged conflicts between stakeholder needs. One student in Group B caught a critical water rights issue: mining operations would compete with local agriculture for scarce water, creating regulatory, community, and operational risks. Estimated post-launch fix: $50 million. Group B took three hours but produced recommendations that survived real-world stress testing.

Microsoft's solution is "AI as provocateur"—systems that challenge their own outputs. Their spreadsheet prototype suggests criteria, sorts data, then generates provocations questioning each criterion's relevance, highlighting hidden biases, and suggesting alternatives. It creates a deliberation loop, not just an approval loop. Capgemini built similar prototypes for leadership development, platform strategy, and multi-stakeholder innovation, all designed to ask rather than answer.

For architects and teams, this highlights a critical organizational design choice. Doer AI optimizes for throughput; thinker AI optimizes for decision quality. Most companies avoid friction and choose speed, but this creates technical debt in judgment. Teams stop pressure-testing assumptions, miss second-order effects, and ship with blind spots. The fix requires intentionally introducing friction in strategic decisions while keeping speed for execution tasks. The uncomfortable truth: if AI outputs make you comfortable, you're probably degrading your team's critical thinking.

**Key takeaways:**
- Microsoft measured declining critical evaluation skills in teams after six months of AI use, with speed gains accompanied by judgment losses
- Doer AI executes tasks (summaries, drafts, automation) while thinker AI challenges assumptions and surfaces overlooked stakeholders
- MBA experiment showed thinker AI identified $50M risks that doer AI missed, despite taking twice as long
- Effective prompt for thinker AI: "Challenge my core assumptions, ask three questions that would make me reconsider, identify risks and stakeholders I'm ignoring—don't provide solutions"
- Deploy thinkers for strategic decisions with multiple stakeholders; keep doers for document drafting and repetitive execution

**Tradeoffs:**
- Thinker AI improves decision quality but sacrifices speed and comfort compared to doer AI that confirms existing thinking
- Introducing deliberation loops increases friction and slows down workflows but prevents costly blind spots in strategic decisions
- Teams that deploy only doer AI gain immediate productivity but accumulate judgment debt that compounds over time
