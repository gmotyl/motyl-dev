## I Just Watched Predator: Badlands. It's About Your Career

**TLDR:** Technical skills decay rapidly (2-5 years), while professionals with strong adaptive capabilities earn 18-24% more. The key isn't knowing more tools—it's knowing how to navigate when those tools change.

**Summary:**

This piece uses an unusual metaphor—the latest Predator film—to explore a critical challenge facing modern professionals. The author argues that we're fundamentally misallocating our learning investments, focusing too heavily on technical certifications that lose value within 2-5 years while neglecting the adaptive skills that actually drive career success.

The IBM research cited here points to something we should all be uncomfortable with: knowledge decay is accelerating. But here's what the author doesn't fully explore—this isn't just about individual career strategy, it's about how organizations structure learning and development. Companies are still rewarding certification accumulation while the real competitive advantage lies in building systems that help people adapt continuously.

The Airbnb example during COVID-19 is instructive, but it reveals something the author glosses over: Chesky's ability to pivot wasn't just personal adaptability—it was enabled by organizational structures that could support rapid experimentation. The technical skills needed in March 2020 didn't exist because the problems didn't exist. This suggests we need to think beyond individual skill-building toward building organizational capabilities for rapid learning and deployment.

The neuroplasticity angle is fascinating but underexplored. Microsoft's approach of daily 7-minute learning modules with AI-adjusted spacing points to something important: the future of professional development isn't about intensive training periods but about continuous, adaptive learning systems. For architects and teams, this means designing learning into the workflow rather than treating it as a separate activity. Consider implementing regular "learning rotations" where team members tackle problems outside their expertise, or creating cross-functional pairs that naturally expose people to different thinking patterns.

What's missing from this analysis is the systemic view. Individual adaptability is necessary but insufficient. Teams and organizations need to build adaptive capacity at multiple levels—technical architecture that can evolve, organizational structures that support experimentation, and cultural norms that reward learning from failure rather than just success.

**Key takeaways:**
- Technical certifications lose half their value in 2-5 years, while adaptive skills provide 18-24% salary premiums
- Adaptability functions like an operating system—it enables you to run whatever "applications" (technical skills) the situation demands
- Deliberate discomfort through cross-functional work and unfamiliar tools builds neuroplasticity and adaptive capacity

**Tradeoffs:**
- Focusing on adaptability over specialization means broader capabilities but potentially less depth in any single area
- Continuous learning approaches improve long-term resilience but require ongoing time investment that could be spent on immediate deliverables
