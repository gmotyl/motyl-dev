## The Bet On Juniors Just Got Better
**TLDR:** AI coding assistants dramatically shorten the learning curve for junior developers, reducing the "valley of regret" and making them a much safer and more profitable bet for engineering teams.

**Summary:**
The conventional wisdom that junior developers are a costly investment with a long and uncertain payoff is being upended by AI. This article argues against the knee-jerk reaction of firing juniors in the age of AI, presenting a compelling case for why the bet on junior talent is now better than ever. The key, the author contends, is to manage juniors for learning, not for production.

The author visualizes the junior developer journey as a curve with a "valley of regret" – the initial period of negative productivity. The longer and deeper this valley, the higher the risk of the junior leaving before becoming a net positive contributor. AI coding assistants, when used for "augmented coding" rather than "vibe coding," can dramatically compress this ramp-up time. By collapsing the search space and providing instant feedback, AI acts as an endlessly patient tutor, allowing juniors to learn faster and more effectively. This not only brings them to profitability sooner but also significantly reduces the attrition rate of junior hires. The article concludes by emphasizing that this accelerated learning doesn't happen automatically; it requires an intentional investment in teaching juniors how to learn with AI.

**Key takeaways:**
*   Manage junior developers for learning, not immediate production output.
*   AI coding assistants can significantly shorten the ramp-up time for junior developers.
*   A shorter learning curve reduces the risk of junior developer attrition.
*   Investing in AI tooling and training for juniors is a high-ROI strategy for engineering teams.
