## Make yourself indispensable at work by solving the AI problem no one sees

**TLDR:** The massive gap between belief in AI's competitive advantage and the failure of most ML projects to reach production is a huge career opportunity. You can become your team's indispensable AI champion by bringing order to the "shadow AI" chaos, even without a technical background.

**Summary:** The article argues that the current widespread, unguided use of AI tools in companies ("shadow AI") creates a significant opportunity for employees who can bring structure and guidance. This "AI Champion" role doesn't require technical expertise but rather curiosity, initiative, and the ability to translate complex AI concepts into practical business applications. The author outlines three key areas for aspiring AI champions to focus on: building AI literacy (technical understanding, practical application, and ethical awareness), identifying team pain points to solve with AI, and demonstrating value through measurable actions. The piece emphasizes that the value is not in being a technical expert, but in being a translator and a guide for colleagues.

**Key takeaways:**
- The gap between AI hype and execution is a career opportunity.
- "Shadow AI" usage is rampant and needs guidance.
- You don't need to be a coder to be an AI champion.
- Focus on AI literacy: technical basics, practical application (prompting), and ethical risks.
- Demonstrate value by solving real problems and measuring the impact.
