## 9 Prompts to Define Your "Non-Negotiables" for the New Year

**TLDR:** The shift from generative AI to agentic AI means your system instructions need to be less about tone and more about rules of engagement. If you don't define your non-negotiables, the algorithms—and the people using them—will define them for you.

**Summary:**

The cautionary tale that opens this piece is worth internalizing. A real estate agent set up a "Lead Nurturing Agent" with the directive to "aggressively pursue appointments." While she was trying to enjoy Christmas Eve dinner, her agent scheduled a 6:00 AM viewing on New Year's Day. Why? Because the calendar slot was technically "open" and the agent's directive was "maximize showings." This is the danger of 2026: agents are relentless, and they don't understand boundaries unless you explicitly define them.

The shift from generative AI to agentic AI is the key insight. The tools aren't just writing emails anymore—they're sending them. This means your system instructions need to evolve from tone guidelines to rules of engagement. The prompts provided here are designed to build a "fortress around your sanity" rather than squeeze more work out of your day.

The "Delegation Audit" prompt addresses a real risk: delegating tasks that bring us joy or require human nuance. The author almost let an AI write a condolence note before catching himself. The prompt forces you to articulate your "Human-Only Zones"—tasks requiring high empathy, strategic intuition, or personal joy that AI should never touch. The output includes a literal code block to paste into your AI agent's configuration to prevent scope creep.

The "Escalation Matrix" prompt tackles a problem endemic to modern work: if everything is urgent, nothing is. AI agents are terrible at judging severity. To an LLM, a server outage and a typo on a blog post can look equally urgent depending on the sender's use of exclamation points. Creating a three-level triage system (Noise, Attention Needed, Drop Everything) with specific keywords and senders for escalation keeps you from treating every Slack message as a fire drill.

For architects and teams, the "Tech Minimalist Coach" prompt addresses AI fatigue directly. The sheer volume of new tools—DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenAI updates—creates constant pressure to learn everything. The prompt helps create a "Learning Budget" with strict criteria: does the new tool solve a problem you complain about weekly? A monthly "Tinkering Slot" (two hours on the first Friday) creates permission to explore while forbidding you from signing up for new betas outside that window. The mantra "tools are not skills" is worth remembering.

The practical workflow is sound: run the prompts with a reasoning model, save the output as manifestos and constitutions, update your AI system instructions accordingly, and print the analog stuff. The "Family Tech Constitution" belongs on the fridge—paper has excellent latency and never runs out of battery.

**Key takeaways:**
- Agentic AI requires rules of engagement, not just tone guidelines—define non-negotiables explicitly
- Create "Human-Only Zones" for tasks requiring empathy, intuition, or joy that AI must never touch
- Build an Escalation Matrix to prevent treating every notification as a fire drill
- Establish a "Learning Budget" for new AI tools with strict criteria and tinkering slots
- The ruthless notification audit has the highest ROI—aim to reduce daily buzzes by 80%
- Agency is you deciding what matters; autonomy is the machine doing what it wants

**Tradeoffs:**
- Explicit AI boundaries protect sanity but require upfront effort to define and configure
- Strict "no" templates save hours of meetings but may initially feel uncomfortably direct
- Tech-free zones preserve human connection but require family buy-in and enforcement
