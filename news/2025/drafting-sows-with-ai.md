## 5 Prompts to Draft SOWs (Statements of Work)

**TLDR:** This article provides a system for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create detailed and "bulletproof" Statements of Work (SOWs). The process focuses on leveraging AI not just for speed, but for its ability to identify potential gaps and ambiguities, helping to prevent the dreaded scope creep that plagues many projects.

**Summary:** The Statement of Work (SOW) is often seen as a tedious, legalistic document that many are reluctant to create. However, a poorly drafted SOW is a primary cause of "scope creep," where client expectations expand beyond the original agreement, leading to uncompensated work and strained relationships. The author shares personal experiences of being burned by casually defined project scopes, such as a simple "API build" that the client expected to have near-magical capabilities. The key insight is that LLMs can be a powerful ally in this process, not just for accelerating the drafting process, but for bringing a level of "paranoia" that helps to surface potential ambiguities and unstated assumptions.

The proposed system focuses on using AI to generate comprehensive SOWs by thoroughly extracting requirements and, crucially, defining the "negative space"—that is, explicitly stating what is *not* included in the project scope. This proactive approach helps to pre-empt misunderstandings and ensures that both the client and the service provider are on the same page from the outset. By prompting an LLM to think through the logical holes and potential edge cases that a human might optimistically overlook, you can create a document that is far more robust than one drafted manually. The goal is to transform the SOW from a dreaded formality into a strategic tool for project success.

For architects and team leads, this approach offers a structured way to offload the tedious aspects of SOW creation while improving the quality of the final document. By using AI as a partner in the process, you can ensure that all technical requirements are clearly defined and that there is no room for misinterpretation. This not only protects the development team from unreasonable demands but also builds trust with the client by demonstrating a high level of professionalism and attention to detail. The article promises to walk readers through the specific prompts and formatting techniques to achieve this, turning a boring task into a valuable, risk-mitigating exercise.

**Key takeaways:**
- A well-drafted SOW is critical for preventing scope creep and ensuring project success.
- LLMs can be used to not only speed up the creation of SOWs but also to identify potential gaps and ambiguities.
- Defining the "negative space" (what's not included) is as important as defining the project requirements.
- Using AI for documentation can bring a level of rigor and "paranoia" that helps to create more robust agreements.
