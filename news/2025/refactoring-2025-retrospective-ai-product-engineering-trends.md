## The Best of Refactoring in 2025

**TLDR:** Luca Rossi's year-end retrospective highlights the dominant themes of 2025: AI becoming impossible to ignore (25% of all Refactoring content was AI-related), product engineering going mainstream, platform engineering maturing, and a brutal tech job market being reshuffled by AI in unexpected ways.

This retrospective serves as a useful map of the engineering leadership conversation in 2025. What strikes me most is the tension Luca identifies: AI is simultaneously making engineers more productive while creating what he calls "cognitive debt" - dependency on AI tools while core problem-solving skills atrophy. This isn't the typical AI doom narrative; it's a more nuanced observation about the hidden costs of productivity gains.

The product engineering trend deserves attention. The idea has existed for a decade, but Luca argues AI is turning it from niche philosophy into the default direction for product teams. The logic is straightforward: AI is collapsing specialties, allowing individuals to span broader areas. PMs are getting closer to code, engineers closer to product. The teams that lean into this rather than resist it are pulling ahead.

Platform engineering emerges as the flip side of this coin. Platform engineers are essentially product engineers whose customers are other engineers - they apply product mindset to internal tooling, creating feedback loops, measuring adoption, treating DX as a first-class concern. The newsletter connects this to a broader insight: developer experience is what separates elite engineering teams from average ones. Not heroic individuals, not cutting-edge tech stacks, but the mundane work of making development smooth.

The hiring and career section is appropriately bleak but honest. The tech job market remained tough across all levels - managers, senior ICs, juniors. But AI added a layer of weirdness: breaking traditional resume screening, enabling unprecedented interview cheating, and fundamentally changing what's expected from new hires. The "generalists in 2025" framing is interesting - as AI handles more routine specialized tasks, breadth becomes more valuable.

For engineering leaders, this retrospective offers a useful framework for self-assessment: Is your team structured for product engineering or siloed specialization? Have you invested in platform/DX? Are your hiring practices adapted to the AI-reshuffled landscape? Are you tracking how AI affects not just productivity but skill development?

The interview highlights are worth noting: Martin Fowler on AI's impact on software development and technical debt, Rands on engineering management evolution, and Antirez (Redis creator) on choosing to build from a small Sicilian town rather than Silicon Valley. These represent the kind of deep practitioner wisdom that's hard to find amid the noise of AI hype.

**Key takeaways:**
- 25% of 2025 engineering content was AI-related - it's now impossible to ignore
- Product engineering is transitioning from niche philosophy to default team structure
- Platform engineering and developer experience separate elite teams from average ones
- The hiring market is being reshuffled by AI in unexpected ways (cheating, changed expectations)
- Cognitive debt from AI dependency is a real but under-discussed concern
