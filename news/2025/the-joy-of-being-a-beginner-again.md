## The surprisingly freeing joy of being bad at something

**TLDR:** Society pressures us to only do things we're good at, which stifles curiosity and playfulness. The author argues that embracing being bad at something new is a powerful antidote to the pressure of perfectionism, especially after burnout, as it rebuilds self-trust and expands your world.

**Summary:** The article delves into the self-imposed pressure to be instantly competent, a mindset that can be particularly damaging after experiencing burnout. This fear of not being "good enough" can shrink one's world and prevent personal growth. The author shares their own experience with learning French and the initial frustration of being a beginner again. However, they discover a surprising sense of freedom in letting go of the need for perfection. Admitting you're bad at something removes the pressure and allows for experimentation and play. This "messy middle" is where creativity and growth happen. The author concludes that confidence isn't a prerequisite for trying new things, but rather a result of trying enough times that you stop caring about how you look.

**Key takeaways:**
- The pressure to be good at everything stifles curiosity and growth.
- Embracing being bad at something is a way to combat perfectionism.
- Allowing yourself to be a beginner can be a powerful tool for burnout recovery.
- Confidence is built through action, not a prerequisite for it.
