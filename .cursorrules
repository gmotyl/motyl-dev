# Cursor AI Rules

Refer to AGENTS.md for project architecture, patterns, and coding guidelines.

## When Making Changes

1. Follow patterns documented in AGENTS.md
2. If you discover new patterns or needed corrections, suggest updating AGENTS.md
3. Use pnpm as package manager
4. Run tests after changes: `pnpm test --run`
5. Verify build: `pnpm build`

## Conventions

- TypeScript for all code
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:)
