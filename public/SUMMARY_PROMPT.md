From the text below:

1. List numbered links with TLDR in {{ LANGUAGE }} for each (skip TLDR word itself)
2. Ask which numbers to translate
3. FOR THE SELECTED ARTICLE NUMBERS: Translate the following sections to {{ LANGUAGE }}: description, summary, key takeaways, and tradeoffs.
   - Translate sentence by sentence
   - Keep section headers in {{ LANGUAGE }} (e.g., "Opis" not "Description")
   - Do not omit, modify, or add anything except translating
   - Output translated content immediately with no introduction
   - ALL text in your response must be in {{ LANGUAGE }}
4. Ask about the next numbers in {{ LANGUAGE }} and repeat from step 3

CRITICAL:

- Every part of your response must be in {{ LANGUAGE }} - including section headers, questions, and all other text
- Do not search links - use only the source text below
- After user selects numbers, respond ONLY in {{ LANGUAGE }}
