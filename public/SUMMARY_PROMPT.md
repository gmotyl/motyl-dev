# Task Overview

Perform the following task step-by-step:

1. Access and read all textual content from {ARTICLE_URL}
2. Your final output must be entirely in **{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}**
3. You will rewrite all the text content from the URL back to me

## Important Note

This is a rewrite, not a summary. Your goal is to faithfully recreate the full content, sentence by sentence, translated into {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}. Do not change the original meaning or structure.

## Crucial Rules for the Output:

### Content to Skip

- **No Code**: You must skip all code blocks and code snippets
- **No Diagrams**: You must skip all diagrams, charts, and visual schematics

### Handling Skipped Content

When you skip a code block or a diagram, you must insert a brief, one-sentence explanation in {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE} and inside brackets. This explanation should state what the code or diagram was demonstrating.

When you skip a diagram, you must insert a brief, one-sentence explanation in {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE} and inside brackets. This explanation should state what the code or diagram was demonstrating.

**Examples:**

- If you skip code: [skiped code: code snippet showing React useEffect hook running once on component mount to perform two initialization tasks: it detects whether the user is on a mobile device by checking the browser's user agent string, and it retrieves a previously saved custom prompt from localStorage to populate the component's state. The empty dependency array [] ensures this initialization logic executes only once when the component first renders.] remember thatoutput must be entirely in **{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}**
- If you skip a diagram: [diagram ilustrating the flow of data in a React component] remeber that output must be entirely in **{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}**

## Execution

Begin the {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE} content reproduction immediately.
