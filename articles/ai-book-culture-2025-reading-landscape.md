## Top AI Books to Read in 2025

**TLDR:** AI Supremacy introduces a new series celebrating AI books, partnering with Paul Morrison's AI Book Review to curate non-technical AI books for 2025. The initiative emphasizes supporting book culture over shallow AI-generated content.

**Summary:**

This article introduces an interesting shift in AI content consumption - moving from rapid-fire newsletter articles to deeper, more researched book content. The collaboration between AI Supremacy and Paul Morrison's AI Book Review represents a pushback against what they call "AI slop" - the synthetic, shallow content flooding the market.

Paul Morrison brings substantial credibility to this endeavor. With over two decades as a business and technology advisor in London, he's worked with major tech companies like Accenture and Hewlett Packard. His decade-long leadership of the Hackett Digital Awards gives him unique insight into measurably impactful AI projects across businesses globally. This practical experience matters when evaluating which AI books actually provide value versus academic theorizing.

The philosophical framework Morrison presents is refreshingly nuanced. He positions AI not as a monolithic force but as "many things - not one, constant thing" that's deeply interconnected with broader societal changes. This systems thinking approach is exactly what's missing from most AI discourse, which tends to either worship or demonize AI without understanding its contextual nature.

What's particularly valuable here is the explicit focus on non-technical books. While technical ML books have their place, the real challenge for most organizations isn't understanding gradient descent - it's figuring out how AI fits into their business strategy, culture, and operational reality. The decision to exclude technical books acknowledges that the biggest AI adoption barriers are often human and organizational, not technical.

For architects and teams, this represents a crucial resource for building organizational AI literacy. Rather than having technical teams translate complex concepts for business stakeholders, curated non-technical books can help create shared vocabulary and understanding across the organization. This is essential for making sound architectural decisions about where and how to integrate AI capabilities.

However, there's something the article avoids discussing: the inherent tension between promoting book culture while operating in the newsletter economy. The authors critique shallow content while participating in the very medium that incentivizes quick, digestible takes over deep thinking. This isn't necessarily hypocritical, but it does raise questions about whether the newsletter format can truly support the kind of thoughtful discourse they're advocating for.

**Key takeaways:**
- Book-length research provides deeper insights than newsletter articles for understanding AI's complex implications
- Non-technical AI books are crucial for organizational AI literacy beyond just technical implementation
- The curation approach matters - having experienced practitioners evaluate books prevents wasting time on theoretical fluff
