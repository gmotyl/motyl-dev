## Tech jobs market 2025, part 3: job seekers' stories

**TLDR:** The tech job market in 2025 shows a rebound in junior engineer hiring, but employers have become pickier with higher bars for remote positions, while AI engineers and those with Big Tech experience remain in high demand.

**Summary:**

This comprehensive analysis from job platforms and over 30 software engineers reveals significant shifts in the tech hiring landscape. The data comes from Wellfound, which hosts around 6 million software engineering profiles, and provides real insights into current market dynamics.

The most striking trend is the falling demand for remote work positions, with companies implementing more barriers and setting higher standards for distributed roles. This represents a notable shift from the pandemic-era embrace of remote work. Simultaneously, there's been a slight uptick in demand for backend engineers compared to other specializations, suggesting companies are prioritizing infrastructure and core system development.

One encouraging development is the apparent rebound in junior engineer recruitment. Both scaleups and publicly traded tech companies are increasingly focusing on hiring new graduates and early-career engineers. This marks a reversal from the hiring freezes that affected entry-level positions in recent years. However, this comes with a caveat - employers have become significantly more selective across all levels.

The current hiring environment is characterized by what can only be described as employer pickiness. Hiring managers are holding out for the "perfect candidate," leading to longer hiring cycles and more rejections without meaningful feedback. Many candidates report that referrals seem to be the only reliable way to secure interviews, suggesting that traditional application processes have become less effective. This selectivity extends to unrealistic expectations about candidate quality, with some employers claiming overall candidate quality has declined.

For architecture teams and engineering organizations, this market presents both challenges and opportunities. The emphasis on backend engineers suggests companies are investing in foundational infrastructure, while the renewed focus on junior hiring indicates a return to building sustainable engineering pipelines rather than relying solely on experienced hires.

**Key takeaways:**
- Remote work demand is declining with higher barriers for distributed positions
- Junior engineer hiring is rebounding as companies invest in early-career talent
- Referrals have become the primary path to interviews in an increasingly selective market
- AI engineers, Big Tech alumni, and infrastructure specialists remain in highest demand
- Engineering leadership roles face particularly tough market conditions

**Tradeoffs:**
- Companies gain access to "perfect" candidates but sacrifice speed and potentially good-enough talent
- Remote work restrictions reduce talent pool size but may improve team cohesion and collaboration
- Higher selectivity may improve hire quality but increases time-to-fill and recruiting costs
