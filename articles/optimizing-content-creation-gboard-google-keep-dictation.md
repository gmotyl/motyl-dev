### TLDR:

Standard voice recorders often create "walls of text" riddled with phonetic errors. By switching to Gboard's voice typing within Google Keep, I've unlocked a real-time, context-aware workflow that makes drafting articles in my native language faster and more accurate before the final AI polish.

## The Limitations of Standard Voice Recorders

Initially, my workflow involved recording voice notes on my phone using a basic dictation app, specifically the built-in Samsung recorder. However, the results were often frustrating. The phonetic transcription was frequently inaccurate, leading to a high volume of errors that required manual correction.

Perhaps the biggest hurdle was the lack of punctuation. Without the ability to dictate periods or commas, I was left with a massive "wall of text." While I developed an AI **prompt** to help clean up these notes, I constantly worried that the AI might hallucinate or inadvertently strip away the nuances of my original thoughts while trying to make sense of the unorganized input.

## The Gboard and Google Keep Advantage

To solve these issues, I transitioned to a new workflow using **[Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin)** (Google Keyboard) and its integrated voice typing feature on Android. Dictating directly into a **[Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep)** document has fundamentally changed the experience for several reasons:

### 1. Real-Time Feedback and Correction

Unlike a recorder that processes the audio after the fact, Google Voice Typing allows me to see the text appear in real-time. If the algorithm misinterprets a word, I can stop and correct it immediately.

### 2. Native Punctuation Support

One of the most significant upgrades is the ability to dictate punctuation. By simply saying "period" or "comma," I can structure my thoughts as I speak. This results in a much cleaner draft that requires significantly less post-processing.

### 3. Contextual Continuity

Working within a document allows me to see the preceding paragraphs. If I get interrupted or need to pause, I can easily return to the note later, read the existing context, and pick up exactly where I left off. This "asynchronous" way of writing makes it much easier to tackle long-form articles during short breaks throughout the day.

## Bridging the Language Gap with AI

Despite being fluent in English and using it daily for work, I still prefer to dictate my initial thoughts in my native Polish. It is physically less exhausting and allows for a more natural, fluid expression of ideas.

The final stage of my workflow remains the same: I take the high-quality Polish draft generated in Google Keep and pass it through **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)**. The AI handles the logical structuring, divides the text into sections, and provides a professional English translation. By providing the AI with a cleaner, punctuated source text, the final output is much more accurate and faithful to my original intent.
