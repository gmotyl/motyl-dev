## 6 ChatGPT Prompts to Find, Test & Prove Your Next Big Idea

**TLDR:** The article presents a systematic approach to startup validation using ChatGPT as a research partner, with detailed prompts for market research, demand analysis, and competitor evaluation. It promises to help founders avoid building unvalidated products by turning intuition into evidence-backed decisions.

**Summary:**

This guide tackles one of the most fundamental problems in entrepreneurship: building solutions without proper validation. The authors present ChatGPT as a "personal startup validation partner" that can help founders research markets, analyze competitors, and predict demand before investing significant time or money. The approach is structured around six specific prompts designed to systematically validate business ideas.

The first prompt focuses on problem identification, positioning ChatGPT as an experienced market research strategist. It asks the AI to conduct deep research across platforms like Reddit, Quora, and niche forums to identify high-value, unsolved problems. The prompt is meticulously structured to deliver a ranked table of problems with scoring criteria including urgency, frequency, willingness to pay, and evidence quality. This systematic approach aims to help founders "fall in love with the problem" rather than their solution.

The second prompt shifts to demand validation, where ChatGPT acts as a market demand analyst evaluating whether people actually care about the identified problems. This step involves analyzing search trends, discussion frequency, and social signals to estimate current and projected interest. The goal is to avoid solving problems that nobody is actively searching for or discussing.

What's particularly interesting about this approach is how it attempts to systematize the traditionally intuitive process of market validation. The prompts are designed with specific role-playing scenarios, detailed context, and structured outputs that mimic professional market research methodologies. The authors emphasize turning "intuition into evidence" and building "what's painful" rather than "what's interesting."

For development teams and product architects, this methodology could be integrated into the early stages of product planning. The systematic approach to problem identification and demand validation could inform technical architecture decisions by ensuring that the underlying business case is solid before significant engineering resources are committed. Teams could use these prompts as part of their discovery phase, potentially saving months of development time on products that lack market demand.

**Key takeaways:**
- Use AI to systematically validate startup ideas before building anything
- Focus on problem identification first, then validate market demand through data analysis
- Structure AI prompts with specific roles, context, and output formats for better results

**Tradeoffs:**
- Gain systematic validation process but sacrifice speed of intuitive decision-making
- Comprehensive market research increases confidence but may lead to analysis paralysis
- AI-generated insights provide broad coverage but may miss nuanced human behaviors
