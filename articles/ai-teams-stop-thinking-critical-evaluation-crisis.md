## Your Team Stopped Questioning AI Six Weeks Ago

**TLDR:** Microsoft Research found that teams using AI for six months show declining critical evaluation skills - they stop questioning AI outputs, leading to costly mistakes like a $2M market entry failure where no one challenged AI-generated assumptions.

**Summary:**

This article exposes a dangerous pattern emerging in AI adoption that most organizations haven't recognized yet. The core insight is devastating in its simplicity: teams aren't failing because AI hallucinates or produces bad outputs - they're failing because they've stopped questioning AI's reasoning altogether. The example of a strategy team's $2M market entry mistake is particularly telling - the AI-drafted plan wasn't technically incorrect, it just made assumptions that went unchallenged because the output "sounded authoritative."

The Microsoft Research finding is the smoking gun here. After six months of AI usage, teams systematically show declining critical evaluation skills. This isn't about individual laziness - it's a predictable cognitive shift where speed and convenience gradually erode judgment. The more tasks teams delegate to AI, the less they question the underlying reasoning. It's a classic case of tools reshaping the humans who use them, not just the work itself.

The article introduces a crucial distinction between "doer AI" and "thinker AI" that most organizations miss entirely. Doer AI executes tasks - drafts emails, summarizes documents, pulls data. It's fast, reliable, and delivers immediate productivity gains. Thinker AI challenges assumptions, spots gaps, asks uncomfortable questions, and forces reconsideration of default thinking. Most teams only deploy doers, which explains why they're getting faster at making worse decisions.

The MBA student experiment with cobalt sourcing illustrates this perfectly. Group A with doer AI delivered recommendations in 90 minutes but missed critical stakeholders and water rights conflicts that could cost $50M to fix post-launch. Group B with thinker AI took three hours but identified these issues during planning. The difference isn't just time - it's the quality of thinking itself.

For architecture teams and engineering organizations, this has profound implications. When AI helps you design systems faster but stops challenging your architectural assumptions, you might be optimizing for the wrong metrics. The question isn't whether your AI tools make you more productive - it's whether they make you think better about complex tradeoffs, edge cases, and long-term consequences.

**Key takeaways:**
- Teams using AI for six months show measurable decline in critical thinking skills as delegation increases
- Most organizations only deploy "doer AI" for execution, missing "thinker AI" that challenges assumptions and improves decision quality
- Microsoft's solution involves AI as provocateur - systems that challenge their own outputs through deliberation loops rather than approval loops

**Tradeoffs:**
- Doer AI increases speed and productivity but sacrifices critical evaluation and judgment quality
- Thinker AI improves decision quality and surfaces hidden risks but requires more time and creates uncomfortable friction
- AI delegation reduces cognitive load but weakens teams' ability to question and validate reasoning
