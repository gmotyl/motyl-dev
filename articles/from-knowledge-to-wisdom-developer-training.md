## From Knowledge to Wisdom 🧠 — with Hywel Carver

**TLDR:** Hywel Carver, CEO of Skiller Whale, discusses why traditional developer training is broken and how live team coaching can bridge the gap between knowledge acquisition and practical wisdom in software engineering.

**Summary:**

This conversation tackles one of the most persistent problems in our industry: the massive gap between what developers learn in traditional training and what they actually need to succeed in real-world software development. Hywel Carver brings a fascinating perspective, having started programming in C at age nine and eventually becoming a CTO before founding Skiller Whale.

The core insight here is the distinction between knowledge, skills, and wisdom in software development. Traditional training excels at knowledge transfer—you can learn React hooks or TypeScript syntax from a course. But skills require practice in realistic contexts, and wisdom only comes from experiencing the consequences of decisions over time. Most training programs stop at knowledge, leaving developers to figure out the skills and wisdom parts on their own, often through painful trial and error in production systems.

What's particularly interesting is Carver's observation about why traditional training fails so spectacularly. It's not just that it's boring or theoretical—though it often is. The fundamental issue is that it treats software development as if it's like learning to drive a car, where you can practice the same skills repeatedly in a controlled environment. But software development is more like being a doctor: every patient (codebase) is different, the context matters enormously, and the decisions you make have long-term consequences that aren't immediately visible.

The live team coaching approach that Skiller Whale uses addresses this by bringing realistic scenarios to teams in their actual working context. Instead of pulling developers out of their work to attend generic training, they bring the training to the team's specific challenges and codebase. This creates what we might call "contextual learning"—where the knowledge being transferred immediately connects to the team's real problems and constraints.

For engineering leaders and architects, this raises important questions about how we think about skill development on our teams. Are we investing in training that actually moves the needle on team capability, or are we just checking boxes? The measurement challenge Carver discusses is crucial here—how do you know if your training investment is working? Traditional metrics like "hours of training completed" or "courses passed" tell you almost nothing about actual capability improvement.

**Key takeaways:**
- Traditional developer training fails because it stops at knowledge transfer without developing practical skills or wisdom
- Live team coaching in real contexts is more effective than generic training programs
- Measuring learning impact requires looking beyond completion rates to actual behavioral and decision-making changes
- AI may change both how we learn and what skills we need to prioritize in software development

**Tradeoffs:**
- Live team coaching provides better context and relevance but sacrifices the scalability of traditional training programs
- Contextual learning improves practical application but may miss broader industry patterns and practices
