# Newsletter CTA Feature Test

This is a test article to verify that the newsletter CTA (Call-To-Action) feature is working correctly.

## What is Newsletter CTA?

The newsletter CTA feature allows you to add a beautiful newsletter signup form directly within your articles by adding the special hashtag `#newsletter-cta` to your article's frontmatter.

## How It Works

When you add the `#newsletter-cta` hashtag to an article:

1. The article content is displayed as normal
2. A newsletter signup section appears after the main content
3. The section includes a title, description, and newsletter subscription form
4. When a user subscribes, you receive an email notification that includes:
   - The subscriber's email
   - The article slug they subscribed from
   - A direct link to the article

## Key Features

- **Customizable messaging**: The CTA title and description are configurable per article
- **Article tracking**: Know which articles are driving newsletter signups
- **Seamless integration**: Works with your existing newsletter system
- **Beautiful design**: Matches the site's design system with gradient backgrounds and smooth interactions
